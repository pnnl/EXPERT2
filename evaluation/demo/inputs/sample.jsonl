Transparent composites are manufactured using a low cost, environmentally friendly vacuum infusion process. Physical and mechanical tests have been conducted. Transparent composites manufactured using the modified vacuum infusion process had a fibre volume fraction of 40%. Tensile strength and tensile modulus of these composites were 374.9 MPa and 31.74 GPa respectively. The results indicate that the transparent composites possess good physical and mechanical properties. These transparent composites form a good base for developing new generation transparent armour systems.", "labels": [15], "labels_text": ["Materials science"], "doc_id": "2204653"}

{"corpus_id": 129261373, "title": "Form and internal structure of active-layer detachment slides, Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories, Canada", "abstract": "Three recent shallow landslides over permafrost are described. Slides occur in low- to medium-plasticity clays containing some bands of silts and fine sands. Slope failure results from rapid thaw at the base of the active layer of soil that is ice-rich due to antecedent two-sided freezing. Displaced slide blocks retain their integrity because of hardening of the active layer by cryodesiccation and summer evaporation. Blocks move over a soft basal shear zone a few millimetres to several centimetres thick. Compression in the toe zone of slides is low at sites where runout is possible, but in other locations causes emergent shears and complex folding. Failure histories are varied and range from simple unitary slides to complex sequential failures in which active-layer segments are mobilized progressively higher up the slope. This study demonstrates the importance of active-layer thermal and hydrological regimes, in addition to material properties, in determining the mode of slope failure.", "labels": [9], "labels_text": ["Environmental science"], "doc_id": "129261373"}
{"corpus_id": 150622017, "title": "The Case for Non-CPA Ownership: A Roundup of Practitioners' Opinions on Why Change Is Needed", "abstract": "How can CPAs keep pace in a rapidly changing business environment? For many, the answer lies in expanding the array of services that firms offer. \"If you look at the Jenkins and Elliott committees and the thrusts they're taking (see THE JENKINS AND ELLIOTT COMMITTEES), at what's happening technologically, at the reengineering that's taking place in corporations; if you believe what you read about traditional, historical financial information losing its relevancy; if you look at what clients are demanding from us in the marketplace, it's clear that a lot of what we'll be doing in the future really is tangential to our attest services,\" says Ronald Cohen, partner in charge of Crowe, Chizek & Co.'s South Bend, Indiana, office and vice-chair of the board of the American Institute of CPAs. For Cohen, branching out into other fields is \"not so much an economic issue in terms of the viability of firms but a matter of listening to clients and giving them what they really want. If we can serve clients better, we're serving the public better. And what clients really want--in addition to the attest services--are a lot of other services that can be provided by people other than CPAs.\" In numerous cases, to offer better service CPA firms have employed professionals from other disciplines. But how can the profession attract and keep these skilled outsiders if they are not allowed to be full owners of CPA firms? How can it ensure their services will meet the same standards of quality that CPAs do? After lengthy study and debate, the AICPA governing council last May overwhelmingly approved a measure permitting those who are not CPAs to be equity owners of CPA firms in some cases (see highlights of the resolution in the THE RESOLUTION: KEY POINTS). In this article, members of the profession speak out on why they favor non-CPA ownership. CHANGING TIMES \"There has been a change away from the traditional approach for CPAs firms,\" says Jerry Sestak, immediate past president of the Nebraska Society of CPAs. Nebraska earlier this year became the first state to allow partial non-CPA ownership of accounting firms. \"The profession is going to have to move into the 21st century,\" says Sestak, who is a partner of Seim, Johnson, Sestak & Quist, an 8-partner Omaha-based firm. \"We're going away from a pure product environment and more into management services. I think allowing non-CPA ownership will help facilitate that.\" Sestak reports no radical changes in his state so far. \"I don't think there's been a big rush to hire non-CPAs, but I think it will become more and more prevalent in the tax, computer and actuarial science areas.\" Sestak has non-CPAs on his own staff, including a nurse who's part of the firm's health care practice. \"We'd certainly like the opportunity and flexibility to offer ownership to a non-CPA in the future.\" Keeping options open also was on the mind of Crowe, Chizek's Cohen, who led an AICPA task force charged with resolving the issue of non-CPA ownership. \"Years ago, before computers, CPAs did all kinds of systems work,\" he says. \"Now, as computers become more and more sophisticated, we're still working on accounting systems, but data processing work doesn't require a CPA. Do we give up that area or do we go out and find the resources to offer the same kinds of services in a more sophisticated environment?\" Finding those resources sometimes means looking outside of the profession. \"In much of the business we do outside the attest function, the person needs expertise that requires education and experience, but he or she doesn't necessarily need audit experience,\" says Marilyn Pendergast, shareholder and chief operating officer of Urbach Kahn & Werlin, Albany, New York, and president of the New York State Society of CPAs. \"For example, tax, computers and employee benefits are highly specialized and have their own body of knowledge. I don't think specialists in those areas have to become CPAs and know about the attest function to qualify to become owners. …", "labels": [3], "labels_text": ["Business"], "doc_id": "150622017"}

{"corpus_id": 204881569, "title": "Integrate GWAS, eQTL, and mQTL Data to Identify Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Genes", "abstract": "It is estimated that the impact of related genes on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is nearly 70%. Identifying candidate causal genes can help treatment and diagnosis. The maturity of sequencing technology and the reduction of cost make genome-wide association study (GWAS) become an important means to find disease-related mutation sites. Because of linkage disequilibrium (LD), neither the gene regulated by SNP nor the specific SNP can be determined. Because GWAS is affected by sample size and interaction, we introduced empirical Bayes (EB) to make a meta-analysis of GWAS to greatly eliminate the bias caused by sample and the interaction of SNP. In addition, most SNPs are in the noncoding region, so it is not clear how they relate to phenotype. In this paper, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies and methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies are combined with GWAS to find the genes associated with Alzheimer disease in expression levels by pleiotropy. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is introduced to integrate GWAS and eQTL/mQTL data. Finally, we prioritized 274 significant SNPs, which belong to 20 genes by eQTL analysis and 379 significant SNPs, which belong to seven known genes by mQTL. Among them, 93 SNPs and 2 genes are overlapped. Finally, we did 10 case studies to prove the effectiveness of our method.", "labels": [2], "labels_text": ["Biology"], "doc_id": "204881569"}

Due to low water solubility of BDEs and resulted narrow ranges of aqueous equilibrium concentration, the linear distribution model showed similar and good fitting efficiency to the linear portion of nonlinear Freundlich curve. For the same sample, the linear and nonlinear model fitting sorption coefficients were close. At the statistically significant level of 0.05 or 0.1, significant relationships of total organic carbon fraction (fOC) with the fitting sorption coefficients can be observed. As for BDE-28, the relationships of fOC and SOM fractions with the single point partition coefficients at different aqueous concentrations of BDEs were significant; while for BDE-47, the relationships became less significant or insignificant, especially at higher aqueous concentrations. The findings in this study may facilitate more understanding on transport and fate of studied BDEs in soil systems.", "labels": [9], "labels_text": ["Environmental science"], "doc_id": "24106605"}
