Identifying candidate causal genes can help treatment and diagnosis. The maturity of sequencing technology and the reduction of cost make genome-wide association study (GWAS) become an important means to find disease-related mutation sites. Because of linkage disequilibrium (LD), neither the gene regulated by SNP nor the specific SNP can be determined. Because GWAS is affected by sample size and interaction, we introduced empirical Bayes (EB) to make a meta-analysis of GWAS to greatly eliminate the bias caused by sample and the interaction of SNP. In addition, most SNPs are in the noncoding region, so it is not clear how they relate to phenotype. In this paper, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies and methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies are combined with GWAS to find the genes associated with Alzheimer disease in expression levels by pleiotropy. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is introduced to integrate GWAS and eQTL\/mQTL data. Finally, we prioritized 274 significant SNPs, which belong to 20 genes by eQTL analysis and 379 significant SNPs, which belong to seven known genes by mQTL. Among them, 93 SNPs and 2 genes are overlapped. Finally, we did 10 case studies to prove the effectiveness of our method. ### Response:","answers":["Biology"],"generation":"Biology","logits":[0.994012177,0.9989259839,0.996294558],"passages":[{"id":"paper_129369209_S2ORC_0","title":"Recent Morphologic Changes at Dog Keys Pass, Mississippi: Formation and Disappearance of Isle of Caprice: ABSTRACT","text":"Recent Morphologic Changes at Dog Keys Pass, Mississippi: Formation and Disappearance of Isle of Caprice: ABSTRACT [SEP] Approximately 70 years ago the Isle of Caprice, originally known as Dog Island, emerged on the northern margin of an interchannel shoals in Dog Keys Pass, located between Horn and Ship Islands, 18 km southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi.

Five long drill cores of lacustrine sediments at Tulelake, northern California, recovered a nearly continuous 331-m-thick record spanning the past 3 m.y. The Brunhes Normal-Polarity, Matuyama Reversed-Polarity, and Gauss Normal-Polarity Chronozones are recognized; within these, the Jaramillo, Olduvai, Reunion(?), and Kaena(?) Subchronozones are present. Six short stratigraphic intervals exhibit anomalous remanent inclinations that may record excursions and brief subchrons within the Brunhes and Matuyama Chronozones. Age estimates suggest correlation of five of the anomalous intervals with (1) one of the Biwa excursions at about 18,000 yr B.P., (2) the Mono Lake excursion at about 27,000 yr B.P., (3) the Blake Reversed-Polarity Subchron at about 114,000 yr B.P., (4) the Kamikatsura Normal-Polarity Subchron at about 850,000 yr B.P., and (5) the Cobb Mountain Normal-Polarity Subchron at about 1.10 Ma. Age of the sixth interval of anomalous inclination is broadly constrained between 117,000 and 180,000 yr B.P. Sixty-three individual tephra layers were characterized by electron-microprobe and X-ray fluorescence analyses of volcanic glass shards. Identified tephra of relatively well known age include (1) the basal airfall pumice at Llao Rock, 7015 yr B.P.; (2) the Trego Hot Springs Bed, 23,400 yr B.P.; (3) the Olema ash bed, between 55,000 and 75,000 yr B.P.; (4) the airfall pumice at Cloudcap Road (\"Pumice Castle-like tephra 2\"), about 120,000 yr B.P.; (5) the Rockland ash bed, about 410,000 yr B.P.; (6) the Lava Creek-B ash bed, 620,000 yr B.P.; (7) the Rio Dell ash bed, about 1.45 Ma; and (8) the Bear Gulch ash bed, about 1.9 Ma. A sedimentation-rate curve based on independently dated tephra and polarity reversals is used to infer age estimates of undated or previously unidentified ash beds. Some of these ash beds are found over large areas of the western United States and eastern Pacific Ocean basin and provide widespread horizons for correlation. Most of the tephra at Tulelake records eruptions from the nearby southern and central Cascade Range of Oregon and northern California, and the Medicine Lake Highland of northern California. Deposition took place during most of the past 3 m.y. within the Tulelake basin; notable periods of slow or sporadic accumulation, or erosion, occurred between about 620,000 and 200,000 yr B.P. and between about 2.5 and 2.1 Ma. Rapid deposition occurred during marine oxygen-isotope stage 6, between about 170 and 125 ka. Regional volcanism during the past 3 m.y. was markedly episodic, with notable volcanic activity from about 2.1 to 1.9 Ma and from 0.4 Ma to the present. ### Response:","answers":["Geology"],"generation":"Geology","logits":[0.9987133741,0.9999996424,0.9999996424],"passages":[{"id":"paper_129369209_S2ORC_0","title":"Recent Morphologic Changes at Dog Keys Pass, Mississippi: Formation and Disappearance of Isle of Caprice: ABSTRACT","text":"Recent Morphologic Changes at Dog Keys Pass, Mississippi: Formation and Disappearance of Isle of Caprice: ABSTRACT [SEP] Approximately 70 years ago the Isle of Caprice, originally known as Dog Island, emerged on the northern margin of an interchannel shoals in Dog Keys Pass, located between Horn and Ship Islands, 18 km southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi.

All these organizations are based on a structure called superlattice which governs the Toeplitz solving procedure and provides many possible implementations. Algorithmic schemes for the implementation of these organizations, suitable for single-processor and multiprocessor environments, are developed. Among them there are order recursive algorithms, parallel-algorithms of O(p) complexity which use O(p) processing elements, and partitioned-parallel algorithms.

The ratio of signal to noise is increased in low scale by orthogonal wavelet transform. The measurement data is decomposed by orthogonal wavelet function and the state and measurement equations can be resolved into different scales. The physical parameters of a dynamic system are estimated by parameter Kalman filter method in different scales. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations indicate that the identification of system parameters in multi-scale is more efficient than in single scale. ### Response:","answers":["Engineering"],"generation":"Engineering","logits":[0.9938615561,0.9992493987],"passages":[{"id":"paper_129369209_S2ORC_0","title":"Recent Morphologic Changes at Dog Keys Pass, Mississippi: Formation and Disappearance of Isle of Caprice: ABSTRACT","text":"Recent Morphologic Changes at Dog Keys Pass, Mississippi: Formation and Disappearance of Isle of Caprice: ABSTRACT [SEP] Approximately 70 years ago the Isle of Caprice, originally known as Dog Island, emerged on the northern margin of an interchannel shoals in Dog Keys Pass, located between Horn and Ship Islands, 18 km southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi.

Necessarily, my arms, legs, head, and torso compose my body; necessarily, my arms, my heart, and the table compose something y; necessarily, my heart and the sun compose something z; and so on. Though there have been a few recent attempts to argue against the necessity of this principle of unrestricted composition the consensus is that if it is true, it is necessarily true. In what follows I will join the few dissenters and argue that this principle of unrestricted composition is not necessarily true. If I am right, it follows that either some principle of restricted composition is necessarily true or the existence of composite objects is a contingent matter. I will end by indicating why the latter option seems the most plausible. I proceed by reductio.

Symptoms occurred most often in the first pregnancy (17 patients) at a mean age of 27 years (range 21-36); the most frequent was back pain in late pregnancy or post partum (n = 18); less common was hip (n = 5) or ankle (n = 1) pain. In most, symptoms improved soon after delivery. Four subjects had pre-existing disorders known to reduce bone density (corticosteroid therapy, heparin treatment, mild osteogenesis imperfecta and previous anorexia nervosa). Radiographs showed vertebral collapse or localized osteoporosis of the hip, with MRI evidence of oedema. Forearm bone mineral density (BMD) was sometimes normal, but spinal BMD (measured by DXA) was low. Bone biopsies in eleven patients showed features compatible with osteoblast failure. Except for the patient with mild osteogenesis imperfecta, cultured dermal fibroblasts synthesized and exported normal Type I collagen.
