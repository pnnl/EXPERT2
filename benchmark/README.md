# NuclearQA: A Human-made Benchmark for Language Models for the Nuclear Domain

<!-- ![Dataset Logo/Icon](dataset_logo.png) -->

## Overview

We introduce NuclearQA: a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models that have been trained on documents in the scientific domain. This is a first-of-its-kind benchmark that has been carefully crafted by human experts to be able to evaluate the scientific understanding and reasoning ability of large language models, specifically in the Nuclear Science and Nuclear Nonproliferation domain.
