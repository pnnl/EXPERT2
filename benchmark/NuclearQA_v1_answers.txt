Neutron moderation and shielding
Pressurized water reactors must have enriched Uranium as most interactions will occur in the thermal neutron region. Molten salt does not qualify as a moderator, therefore most of the reactions will occur in the fast neutron region. Non or low-enriched Uranium is used for molten salt reactors.
To further control the criticality of the reaction.
Boron
The amount of energy expelled or needed to make the reaction happen. If the value is negative, reaction is endothermic. If the value is positive, reaction is exothermic.
A neutron becomes a proton
Continuous discharge
Fluorescence is the immediate emission of photons during an interaction. Phosphorescence is the delayed emission of photons during an interaction.

Oxygen
Beta decay
Fertile means it can be converted into a fissionable material through a neutron absorption. Fissile means the material is readily fissionable.

Iron-55
It would increase
Because the energy it costs to run the particle accelerators far exceeds the energy released during the fusion reaction
Deuterium atoms get accelerated to approximately 100 keV into a stationary tritium target. The output is a 14.1 MeV neutron and a He-4 atom
To obtain cross sections for nuclear reactions that involve difficult-to-produce targets.

Highly enriched uranium increases the U-235 content. U-235 has a high chance to fission when a thermal neutron is absorbed. Therefore, the more U-235 you have, the higher the probability that the neutron will be absorbed by U-235. Also, the total number of fissions that the fuel can undergo will increase.
Because the neutron is not electrically charged
The incident particle interacts with the scintillating material which causes a photon to be emitted. This photon will sometimes be directed toward a photomultiplier tube which absorbs the photon, emits an electron, and that electron creates a cascade of electrons which is detected by instrumentation.
Nuclear waste can be recycled to create Pu-239 for future reactor use, more heat is generated per unit fuel, creates more fuel than it uses,
Because water is common on the surface of the earth.
3.46e+20 atoms/cc
Because the heat capacity of heavy water is greater than that of light water. Therefore, more heat can be absorbed by the core. This means less fissions are needed to create heat.
The band gaps in a germanium crystalline structure are extremely small which makes the resolution of a germanium detector excel compared to other detectors. However, this also means that leakage current can be an issue if the crystal is not cooled properly during use.
The electric field near the anode wire is so strong that the gas multiplication factor is extremely high. This means that when an event happens, so many electrons are created during a successful avalanche that the electronics can’t tell the difference between particles.

The fuel and the moderator are mixed together to form a single, homogeneous material.
Cosmic protons interact with Earth’s magnetic field and neutrons are emitted.
They annihilate and two 511 keV photons are emitted.
Because they have such high energies that they only deposit partial energy into a radiation detection medium.
There would be inadequate amount of shielding between the driver and the core. Cooling the core in a car would be an issue. A car wreck could happen that would cause the core to be exposed.
