The superposition is selected such that the susceptibilities of the respective transitions, in individual species, destructively interfere leading to improved stability and reduced systematic shifts. We present and analyze two examples of such combinations. The first uses the optical quadrupole transitions in a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ - $^{174}$Yb$^+$ two-ion crystal.

The concept of the proper clock is presently best realized by atomic clocks, whose development as precision instruments has evolved very rapidly in the last decades. To put a historical prospective on this progress since the year AD 1000, the time stability of various clocks expressed in terms of seconds of time error over one day of operation is shown. This stability of operation must not be confused with accuracy. Stability refers to the constancy of a clock operation as compared to that of some other clocks that serve as time references. Accuracy, on the other hand, is the ability to reproduce a previously defined frequency. The issues are outlined that must be considered when accuracy and stability of clocks and oscillators are studied. In general, the most widely used resonances result from the hyperfine interaction of the nuclear magnetic dipole moment and that of the outermost electron, which is characteristic of hydrogen and the alkali atoms. During the past decade hyperfine resonances of ions have also been used. The principal reason for both the accuracy and the stability of atomic clocks is the ability of obtaining very narrow hyperfine transition resonances by isolating the atom in some way so that only the applied stimulating microwave magnetic field is a significant source of perturbation. It is also important to make resonance transitions among hyperfine magnetic sublevels where separation is independent, at least to first order, of the magnetic field. In the case of ions stored in traps operating at high magnetic fields, one selects the trapping field to be consistent with a field-independent transition of the trapped atoms."}

Connecting all three types of clocks by an optical frequency comb, the ratios of the clock frequencies are determined with uncertainties smaller than possible through absolute frequency measurements.

Hence, this relation provides a proposed link between the key self-organizing systems, the basic sciences, the forces of nature, and the fundamental particles which is in line with what is already known.

Our calculation shows that for the same Tc-99 loading amount, the effect on the PWR k eff after coating Tc-99 on the PWR fuel rods is much less than that of the homogeneous addition of Tc-99 to uranium dioxide nuclear fuel. If we just coat 0.2\u03bb c (0.0065 mm) thickness Tc-99 on PWR fuel rods, the total Tc-99 coating amount is about 291.37 kg, this is approximately equivalent to the 4 PWR Tc-99 annual outputs, and the system k eff merely decreases to 0.98530. Loading Tc-99 to the PWR is equivalent to introducing extra poisons to PWR system to control excess reactivity, some control poisons like boric acid concentration in primary coolant or burnable poison rods in fuel assemblies are needed to be removed to keep the reactor in criticality. As Tc-99 coating thickness increases from 0.05\u03bb c to 0.2\u03bb c , no matter which substitution pattern is used, B16\u219212 or C16\u219212, the system k eff variations are almost the same and can return to criticality again after removing corresponding burnable poison rods from fuel assemblies.

They are known as ADS and they have as their main goal, the actinides transmutation. The neutron source, which keeps the reactions in a subcritical reactor, is very intense, that is why a high energy proton accelerator is required. For many applications, it is important to design methods to measure the intensity of the source. ADS are expected to work in a subcritical range between 0.92< keff <0.97 and because of that, control rods have a limited use and many designers are considering not to include them. They can be substituted by reflector or combustible elements displacements. In order to calibrate in reactivity these displacements, one can either take advantage of the pulsing structure of the neutron source in microseconds time scale, or can design methods for the minute time scale wherein the source is constant, that is the objective we want to achieve here. If the reactivity control is made with the reflector, in between the extreme states of open reflector and closed reflector, both keff are calculated and a reactivity ramp is estimated appropriate to the reflector movement velocity. This calibration should be made empirically by measuring the response to the ramp with neutron detectors. In the response to the ramp, the specific parameters are: the source intensity, the initial keff and the ramp slope, which defines the objective to be reached in the calibration process. Measurements are available from experimental subcritical reactors in the operation range of the ADS, which allow getting ready this calibration method based on the reactivity ramps. However, in order to fit the measurements to a theoretical model, the point kinetics equations need to be solved for this case. With the Prompt-Jump approximation and the consideration of slow ramp compared to the time constants of delayed neutrons, the integration of these equations and the non-linear fit of the measurements to the resulting method are detailed. The static approximation is enough when the reactor is in a typical subcritical state. However, when close to a critical state, the reactivity is no longer a ramp but a parabola which lead us to estimate the neutron source by means of a non-linear fit of the experimental values and assuming a known reactivity initial value."}

This not only permits a longer core life but can also be used to level the power distribution. Commercial nuclear reactors commonly use B{sub 4}C in separate non-fueled rods and more recently, zirconium boride coatings on the fuel pellets or gadolinium oxide mixed with the fuel. Although the advantages are great, there are problems with using these materials. Boron, which is an effective neutron absorber, transmutes to lithium and helium upon absorption of a neutron. Helium is insoluble and is eventually released to the interior of the fuel rod, where it produces an internal pressure. When sufficiently high, this pressure stress could cause separation of the cladding from the fuel, causing overly high centerline temperatures. Gadolinium has several very strongly absorbing isotopes, but not all have large cross sections and result in residual burnable poison reactivity worth at the end of the fuel life. Even if the amount of this residual absorber is small and the penalty in operation small, the cost of this penalty, even if only several days, can be very high. The objective of this investigation was to study the performance of single isotopes in order to reduce the residual negative reactivity left over at the end of the fuel cycle. Since the behavior of burnable poisons can be strongly influenced by their configuration, four forms for the absorbers were studied: homogeneously mixed with the fuel, mixed with only the outer one-third of the fuel pellet, coated on the perimeter of the fuel pellets, and alloyed with the cladding. In addition, the numbers of fuel rods containing burnable poison were chosen as 8, 16, 64, and 104. Other configurations were chosen for a few special cases. An enrichment of 4.5 wt% {sup 235}U was chosen for most cases for study in order to achieve a 4-year fuel cycle. A standard pressurized water reactor fuel core was chosen for the study, and state-of-the-art neutronic reactor core computer codes were used for analysis. Power distribution, fuel burnup, reactivity due to burnable poisons and other fission products, spectrum shift, core reactivity, moderator void coefficients, as well as other parameters were calculated as a function of time and fuel burnup. The results not only showed advantages of separation of burnable poison isotopes but revealed benefits to be achieved by careful selection of the configuration of even naturally occurring elements used as burnable poisons. The savings in terms of additional days of operation is shown in Figure 1, where the savings is plotted for each of six favorable isotopes in the four configurations. The benefit of isotope separation is most dramatic for dysprosium, but even the time savings in the case of gadolinium is several days. For a modern nuclear plant, one day's worth of electricity is worth about one million dollars, so the resulting savings of only a few days is considerable. It is also apparent that the amount of savings depends upon the configuration of the burnable poison."}

To achieve a long operational time without reloading of the fuel, a high fissile fuel load is required, to provide the required excess reactivity which needs to be compensated to allow safe operational states in all stages of the life of the core. This is achieved through the means of reactivity control methods. In this article we deploy a design methodology for controlling the reactivity in a design based on the U-Battery. The initial excess reactivity within the core was 2000 pcm, implying that the reactivity control systems were required to bring this to unity. To reduce this reactivity, we investigated three main reactivity control methods. Initially the control rod designs which is kept constant. Then a full range of fixed burnable poison designs are evaluated. The final reactivity control method investigated the process of flux spectrum hardening by changing the moderation within the core. This work managed to identify that maximum full power days without any reactivity control as 1364 days. The fixed burnable poisons deployed reduced this lifetime by 62 days due to a reduced neutron economy. However, by removing part of the central reflector the flux spectrum hardens (increases the proportion of fast neutrons) this provides additional bred plutonium provided an additional 62 full power operating days. The meant that the overall design saw no lifetime reduction due to reactivity control devices, without including the use of control rods. Due to the implemented reactivity control systems, the highest point of reactivity has been identified as 1.03, this meant that the control rod position required to reduce this reactivity is limited to the maximum of 50% insertion. Identifying the power profile at this position showed additional loading at the fuel below this point, where additional thermal distribution work will be undertaken."}

To solve this problem, I have found a optimization method consisting of two steps. In the first step, approximation formulas describing a time-dependent relation among effective absorption cross sections (\u03a3aBP), NBP and r are used to select promising combinations of NBP and r beforehand. In the second step, the best combination of NBP and r is determined by a comparison between \u03a3aBP of each promising combination and expected one. The number of survey calculations was reduced to about 1\/10 by the optimization method. The change in keff for 600 burnup days was reduced to 2%\u0394k by the method. Hence, it was made possible to operate reactors practically without inserting the control rods into cores."}

The reactor safety requires the development of a method to monitor criticality. In this paper, an accurate analytical solution for point kinetics equations with one-group delayed neutron and extraneous neutron source is introduced to calculate the change of neutron density, which considers that the reactor does not reach steady state before a new reactivity is added. A comparison with the traditional methods indicates the superiority and validity of the developed analytical solution.

As the progression in the development of technology occurred, a new understanding for a focus on establishing a safety culture within the nuclear industry developed, this in turn has led over the decades post ceding the early years of nuclear, a decrease in the number of nuclear criticality incidents. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief summary of historical (pre 2000) criticality accident statistics and conclusions, while focusing on nuclear criticality incidents occurring after 2000. In preparing the historical overview statistics, it was found that there were several Russian submarine nuclear criticality accidents occurring before 2000 that were not previously widely presented in the public domain. Furthermore, noted were instances of Japanese power companies covering up rod withdrawal accidents, leading to unintended nuclear criticalities. To add in this other information to previously understood practices, a new method of characterizing criticality accident near misses is to be presented, followed by data analysis showing that the safety culture that has evolved since the emergence of nuclear energy on the world stage has provided the platform for the development of a strong and relevant nuclear criticality safety stance."}

Leung1,2 1University of California, Department of Nuclear Engineering, Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA94720 2Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Acceleration & Fusion Research Division, Berkeley, CA94720 Abstract- A compact D-D\/D-T fusion based neutron generator is being designed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to have a potential yield of 1012D-D n\/s and 1014D-T n\/s. Because of its high neutron yield and compact size (~20 cm in diameter by 4 cm long), this neutron generator design will be suitable for many applications. However, some applications required higher flux available from nuclear reactors and spallation neutron sources operated with GeV proton beams. In this study, a subcritical fission multiplier with kef!of 0.98 is coupled with the compact neutron generators in order to increase the neutron flux output. We have chosen two applications to show the gain in flux due to the use offission multipliers - in-core irradiation and out-of-core irradiation. For the in-core irradiation, we have shown that a gain of ~25 can be achieved in a positron production system using D-T generator. For the out-of-core irradiation, a gain of 17 times is obtained in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) using a D-D neutron generator. The total number of fission neutrons generated by a source neutron in a fission multiplier with keff is ~50. For the out-of-core irradiation, the theoretical maximum net multiplication is ~30 due to the absorption of neutrons in the fuel. A discussion of the achievable multiplication and the theoretical multiplication will be presented in this paper. The high neutron yield makes this new generation of neutron generator suitable for a wide variety of applications for which those conventional neutron generators are unable to provide sufficient flux. As some scientists and engineers are building more powerful neutrons sources such as highly enriched uranium (HEU) fueled research reactors and spallation neutron sources for applications that require higher neutron flux, people also try the approach of increasing the neutron flux from neutron generators by a fission multiplier. The idea of using a fission multiplier is not new; its concept is similar to those accelerator driven systems (ADS) for transmutation of nuclear waste. Instead of driving the subcritical pile by a spallation neutron source to transmute hazardous nuclear waste, the D-D\/D- T neutron driven fission multiplier is targeted to applications that re~uire a neutron yield in the range of 1014to 10 6 nls The feasibility of using a D-D\/D- T fusion neutron driven fission multiplier is studied for two types of applications in this paper. One application of thermal neutrons is to induce prompt y-rays by the capture process in 113Cd that the y-rays from the capture process so can produce positron by the pair production process.1 The system for positron production described in Reference 1 is consisted of a 113Cd cap with a dimension of 6.5 cm diameter by 6.5 cm long with platinum plates inside. On the 113Cdcap, thermal neutrons are captured to produce high-energy y-rays. The platinum foils inside the 113Cd cap generate positrons by stopping some of these y-rays with the pair production process. The platinum foils also act as a positron moderator because of its negative work function of -1.8 eV in polycrystalline Pt.2 In this study, the 113Cd cap is placed very closed to a subcritical pile driven by a D-T neutron generator. The discussion presented in this paper is limited to the parameters that affect the optimization of thermal neutron absorption rate in the 113Cd cap. I. INTRODUCTION The other application being investigated is a subcritical multiplier driven bt a D-D neutron generator with a yield of 10 2 nls for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). Previously, a D-T neutron source with a yield of 1014 nls is The compact D-D\/D- T fusion neutron generator currently under development by the Ion Beam and Technology (IBT) Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has an expected yield of 1012and 1014nls respectively. The high neutron yield is envisioned because of its innovative cylindrical shaped RF driven ion source. The ions are extracted radially toward a cylindrical target around the source. This geometric arrangement allows a large target area with a small source size. shown to be adequate to give a treatment time of ~45 minutes.3 However, there is an interest to use a subcritical pile to boost the neutron yield from a D-D neutron generator due to the public awareness and concerns of using tritium in a hospital environment. Unlike fission converter plates that convert the thermal neutrons in a research reactor to fast neutrons, a subcritical fission multiplier is designed to increase the flux of a neutron source. Because most neutrons produced in a reactor are thermalized when they get out of the reactor core, it is necessary to convert these thermal neutrons into fast neutrons"}

The distinctive feature of RF-discharge is its capability to generate high atomic hydrogen species, high current densities and stable and long-life operation. The axial neutron generator is designed for applications that require fast pulsing together with medium to high D-D neutron output. The co-axial neutron generator is aimed for high neutron output with cw or pulsed operation, using either the D-D or D-T fusion reaction. The point source neutron generator is a new concept, utilizing a toroidal-shaped plasma generator. The beam is extracted from multiple apertures and focus to the target tube, which is located at the middle of the generator. This will generate a point source of D-D, T-T or D-T neutrons with high output flux. The latest development together with measured data will be discussed in this article."}

However, in certain young adults, in pregnant women and in children, stable isotope tracers offer a practical alternative for answering important metabolic questions. In the last decade, the developmental problems previously associated with employing stable isotope tracers for this purpose have largely disappeared. Furthermore, the use of stable isotopically labelled materials offers certain additional advantages which are either difficult or impossible to achieve using radiotracers. These include the ability to measure simultaneously substrate content and isotopic enrichment with very high specificity and precision, the ability to determine the intramolecular location of the label, the ability to use the mass of the stable isotope substrate as a probe of the metabolite system response to perturbation, and the ability to study simultaneously and repeatedly the same subject with multiple substrate tracers. The practical application of these principles has been amply demonstrated by the expanding use of non-radioactive tracers to study body composition, energy balance, and the inter-organ transport and oxidation of the three major metabolic fuels--glucose, fat and amino acids. Continued development in the organic synthesis of new, stable isotopically labelled biochemicals will allow investigation of additional areas of biomedical importance which have been hitherto inaccessible to this approach, particularly in the pathophysiology of metabolic events in the growing child."}

The fluorescence quantum yield is higher for exposed tryptophans and this is expressed in longer lifetime (Grinvald and Steinberg, 1976); in contrast long lifetime of phosphorescence appears to correlate with burial. Phosphorescence, spin-disallowed, is much longer lived than fluorescence. This allows the structural\/dynamic characterization of proteins to be studied on a new time regime. A really remarkable finding of studies of protein phosphorescence is that there is such variability both in phosphorescence lifetime and quenchability. We would interpret this to indicate that the tryptophan environment can range from essentially a crystal, almost comparable in rigidity as found at 77 K, to tryptophans in a flexible environment, almost as flexible as free in solution.

Like fluorescence, phosphorescence intensities and lifetimes are useful for studying protein structure. Phosphorescence differs from fluorescence, however, in several ways. Phosphorescence occurs on a time-scale of msec-sec, while fluorescence decays in nanoseconds. Second, the phosphorescence decay of a single tryptophan is nearly monoexponential, making assignments of decay components to individual residues possible. Finally, phosphorescence is a more sensitive probe of the local tryptophan environment, as the lifetime can change by orders of magnitude depending on site rigidity and other factors. The authors describe applications of phosphorescence spectroscopy for protein study. In particular, tryptophan phosphorescence quenching by resonance energy transfer to freely diffusing acceptors was used to show that Trp 109 is the origin of phosphorescence in E. coli alkaline phosphatase (AP). By following changes in the emissive lifetime of this deeply buried residue, the presence of an enzymatically active but structurally modified intermediate state is detected in the unfolding of AP in high concentrations of Guanidine:HCl, and followed the kinetics of the decline in activity upon further unfolding. In addition to the new understanding of AP, the results of these experiments show that room temperature tryptophan phosphorescence is a powerful tool for the study of proteins.\u00a9 (1992) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Multidimensional Langevin equations are employed to describe time evolution of collective coordinates with a time-dependent potential energy surface corresponding to different stages of surrogate reactions. The new model is capable of calculating spin distributions of the compound nuclei, one of the most important quantities in the surrogate technique. Furthermore, various observables of surrogate reactions can be calculated, for example, energy and angular distribution of ejectile and mass distributions of fission fragments. These features are important to assess validity of the proposed model itself, to understand mechanisms of the surrogate reactions, and to determine unknown parameters of the model.

Without assuming specific (schematic) spin-parity distributions, it was found that the surrogate ratio method can be employed to determine neutron fission and capture cross sections if 1) weak Weisskopf-Ewing condition (defined in this paper) is satisfied, 2) there exist two surrogate reactions whose spin-parity distributions of the decaying nuclei are almost equivalent, and 3) difference of the representative spin values between the neutron-induced and surrogate reactions is no much larger than 10 $\\hbar$. If these conditions are satisfied, we need not to know the spin-parity distributions populated by the surrogate method. Instead, we should just select a pair of surrogate reactions which will populate the similar spin-parity distributions, using targets having similar structure and reactions having the similar reaction mechanisms. Achievable accuracy is estimated to be around 5 and 10 % for fission and capture channels, respectively, for nuclei of the Uranium region. The surrogate absolute method, on the contrary, can be marginally applicable to determination of fission cross sections. However, there will be little hope to apply this method for capture cross section measurements unless the spin-parity distributions in the neutron-induced and surrogate reactions are fairly close to each other or the difference can be corrected theoretically. The surrogate ratio method was shown also to be a robust method in the presence of breakup reactions, again, without assuming specific breakup reaction mechanisms."}

When plotted in this fashion, both desired secondary electron and spurious background signal components fall onto respective master curves, with the amplitude being a function of anode bias only. These master curves can be described by simple Townsend Gas Capacitor equations using only two gas-specific parameters. As long as single scattering conditions apply, this approach allows for simplified, direct comparison of the gain characteristics of different gases and allows more intelligent selection of imaging conditions. The utility of treating signal amplification in this manner is demonstrated through a series of images collected under a variety of conditions, but with the ratio of pressure to amplification field strength kept constant. In practice, the range of operational parameter space in which this description can be applied to imaging is limited, as images typically have a mixture of secondary and backscattered contributions."}

The [C \uf769] area filling factors lie below 2% at all positions, consistent with low volume filling factors of the emitting gas.

Both strip detectors and pixel arrays (with Indium bump bonds) have been realized on the curved topography. The key micro-fabrication technique for curved topography, so called \u201cgray-tone lithography\u201d, will be introduced and discussed. We demonstrated low-noise performance by successfully detecting low-energy gamma-rays with a curved strip detector. The energy resolution was \u223c 1.73 keV FWHM at 59.5 keV for the pixel detector.

Some basic principles of radiation interaction highlight the governing factors and pitfalls in detector selection. Measuring condition and data evaluation is reviewed and is further scrutinized in specific cases of in situ radiotracer methods. Detectors of three major types are used most frequently for measuring \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3(X)-radiation; these are gaseous counters, scintillation, and semiconductor detectors. The most widely used gas-filled detectors are the proportional and Geiger counters. The counters are equipped with a thin window that can transmit low energy X- and \u03b3-rays as well as \u03b2-radiation. Photons or electrons penetrate the window and pass into the gas inside where interactions with the gas atoms result in the creation of a number of ion pairs. The most important parameters of scintillators are density, average atomic number, size, purity, refraction index, fluorescence emission maximum, optical transmission, light yield, decay constant, linearity between particle energy and scintillation intensity, and resolution. The most common X-ray and gamma-ray detectors use lithium-drifted silicon Si(Li) or lithium-drifted germanium Ge(Li)."}

It is assumed that the thermal neutrons are created, with a uniform density, throughout the carbon and none created in the U or U3O8. In case of the metal, this assumption is well realized, and even in-the case of the oxide the number of neutrons slowed down in the U3O8 remains small (.0875 Mo\/Mq where Mo and Mq are the masses of oxide and of carbon per cell). It will be further assumed that one can attribute to the thermal neutrons definite absorption and scattering cross sections both in the damper and the U or U3O8, just as if they had one definite energy. This assumption is hardly justifiable, since Maxwell\u2019s energy distribution covers a wide energy range. This is particularly significant for the metal, in which there hardly is any energy exchange between neutrons and scatterer. Thus the low energy neutrons, which are most easily absorbed in the outer layers of the U, will not be replenished as the neutrons penetrate further inward and one must expect, even on the average, a higher than thermal energy for the neutrons in the inside of the metal. However, it would be very difficult to take the polyenergetic nature of the thermal neutrons into account rigorously and, at least for the small spheres which seem to offer most prospects, assuming a single energy value for all thermal neutrons will not introduce a great error. This may be particularly true if the constants entering the calculation are obtained under experimental conditions closely approximating those in the arrangement in question."}

Physicists plot the known nuclei on a gridlike chart with the number of protons running up the chart and the number of neutrons running across it. The nuclei lie in a broad swath that is bounded above by the so-called proton drip line, which shows which combinations of protons and neutrons are too rich in protons to form a nucleus, and below by the neutron drip line, which shows which combinations are too loaded with neutrons to stick together (see [figure][1]). According to two theoretical models, aluminum-42 lies on the wrong side of the neutron drip line and should not exist, even fleetingly. ::: ::: ![Figure][2] ::: ::: A nucleus too far. ::: Two calculations of the drip line (solid and dashed lines) suggest that aluminum-42 shouldn't exist. ::: ::: CREDIT: ADAPTED FROM T.

That's because aluminum-42 has one lone neutron in a \u201cshell\u201d that can hold as many as four. In fact, the team spotted one possible example of aluminum-43, as well as the nucleus magnesium-40. But the possibility that 32 neutrons could be packed into the aluminum nucleus means that the neutron drip line may lie too far away to be reached even with new facilities such as Japan's Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory at the RIKEN laboratory in Wako or Germany's Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research under construction at GSI in Darmstadt, Thoennessen says. ::: ::: To make aluminum-42, the MSU team blasted calcium-48 nuclei, which have 20 protons and 28 neutrons, through a tungsten target. Very rarely, the violent collision stripped off seven of a calcium-48 nucleus's protons and gave it an extra neutron to make aluminum-42. To make aluminum-45, the incoming nucleus would have to snatch up four neutrons, an event so improbable that seeing it is \u201creally at the edge of what's possible in any foreseeable future,\u201d Thoennessen says. ::: ::: Not everyone is convinced that the drip line has retreated beyond reach. \u201cIt's an open question whether this [observation] pushes the drip line out generally or if there is a little bulge in that region\u201d around aluminum, says Richard Casten of Yale University. Witold Nazarewicz, a theorist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, says that the position of the drip line was not known precisely to begin with. \u201cI think that most theorists would say that the models they looked at are simply not reliable for subtle details along the drip line,\u201d he says. ::: ::: Even so, the existence of aluminum-42 undermines a key concept in nuclear physics, Sorlin says.

So the fact that aluminum-42, with 29, holds together even for an instant suggests that the \u201cmagic number\u201d 28 disappears at the drip line, Sorlin says.

When a material is removed from a local region of a reactor to leave a void, there is a change of reactivity. The effect may be particularly prominent in liquid moderated reactors where the liquid coolant has an appreciable moderating effect and voidage is more likely to occur. In this case, fuel is not being removed, but the removal of moderator will affect absorption, moderation, and allow streaming of neutrons through the void. There may be local variations in reactivity effects so that the size and even the sign of the reactivity effect of a void vary along a coolant channel. The chapter also describes reactor thermal transients. Temperature effects in reactors can be conceptually divided between inherent and external feedback, the latter arising as changes in demand that affect the turbine and the way in which coolant is drawn off or its state on return to the reactor. It is significant that there is a certain amount of thermal inertia so that there are time delays in establishing new temperatures."}

The average apparent temperature of neutrons decreases almost linearly with moderator temperature. An absorber in the moderator displaces the spectrum toward higher energies and at the same time lowers the total flux by an exponential factor. For a moderator with good slowing-down power the spectrum shows only cooling and no intensity increase up to a very definite volume. Displacement of the spectrum by moderation depends on the chemical nature of the moderator. (T.R.H.)"}

The facility uses a 2 GeV proton beam to produce neutrons from a tungsten target. The neutrons are then moderated in a moderator assembly consisting of both liquid hydrogen and water compartments. Surrounding the moderator are 22 beamports, which view the moderator's outside surfaces. The beamports are connected to long neutron guides that transport the moderated neutrons to the sample position via reflections. As well as the desired moderated neutrons, fast neutrons coming directly from the target can find their way down the beamlines. These can create unwanted sources of background for the instruments. To mitigate such a kind of background, several instruments will use curved guides to lose direct line-of-sight (LoS) to the moderator and the target. In addition instruments can also use shielding collimators to reduce the amount of fast neutrons further traveling down the guide due to albedo reflections or streaming. Several different materials have been proposed for this purpose. We present the results of a study of different options for collimators and identify the optimal choices that balance cost, background and activation levels."}

The simulation of the gap water flow between fuel assemblies in a reactor core is done with aid of the porous media approach. The analysis of flow and heat transfer is usually based on the Navier-Stokes and energy equation, but the geometric complexity of the flow region of the gap prevents general solutions of the detailed velocity and temperature fields. Instead, macroscopic conservation equations have to be employed by volume averaging of the microscopic conservation equations. The equations are derived in dependency of specific parameters like the porosity. Due to the volume averaging, an additional coefficient, called permeability, and a resistance function have to be determined. This determination has been done both with the aid of pressure loss correlations and with a CFD analysis using the software STAR-CD. The results have been compared and applied to the macroscopic conservation equations. Finally the parameters and equations are implemented in a simulation software called Comsol (Femlab). A parametric study with different moderator mass flow rates at a given coolant temperature distribution showed that a minimum moderator mass flow rate will be required to avoid natural convection in the gap volume, and thus to ensure a stable neutron flux distribution in the core."}

These are nuclear reactors in which an organic liquid, known as the coolant, is used to remove the heat calories set up in the nuclear fuel and in certain circumstances also to slow down the neutrons and make them more suitable for capture by the uranium nucleus, in which case they are called moderators. In certain reactor types, the organic liquid fulfils two functions, while in others it merely acts as a coolant, heavy water then being used as the moderator. It is this latter type which is being developed in Europe by Euratom. In systems of this type, the organic liquid raust be subjected to a very high temperature (375 to 450\"C) and also to a considerable radiation flux (several watt\/gram), so that there are very few organic molecules which can withstand such conditions. Hitherto the use of polyphenyls has been advocated, but although they are fairly satisfactory, their excessively high solidification point constitutes a certain technological drawback. Also the cost, which is still fairly high,more \u00bb restricts their use, for consumption runs to several grams per kwh of electrical energy produced, owing in particular to radiolysis. Under a contact concluded with Euratom (ORGEL Program), the Institut Francais du Petrole (French Petroleum Institute) has carried out studies on the various aromatic petroleum cuts which the oil industry can supply cheaply. On the basis of their thermal and radiolytic siability, the alkyl phenarthrene'' cuts extracted from the power-forming residue were chosen as the most suitable. By virtue of their origin, these cuts have the advantage of being completely free from impurities and entirely aromatic. Their radiolytic stability is excellent, being better than that of the terphenyls. Their thermal stability, which is less satisfactory, must be improved by additional refining. The preparation, purification, characteristics, and detailed composition of these cuts are outlined together with their behavior during high-temperature irradiation tests in a loop installed in the Melusine pile at the Grenoble Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires.

The first mass-independent isotope effect which chemically discriminates isotopes by their nuclear spins and nuclear magnetic moments rather than by their masses was detected in 1976. It was named as the magnetic isotope effect because it is controlled by magnetic interaction, i.e., electron-nuclear hyperfine coupling in the paramagnetic species, the reaction intermediates. The effect follows from the universal physical property of chemical reactions to conserve angular momentum (spin) of electrons and nuclei. It is now detected for oxygen, silicon, sulfur, germanium, tin, mercury, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and uranium in a great variety of chemical and biochemical reactions including those of medical and ecological importance. Another mass-independent isotope effect was detected in 1983 as a deviation of isotopic distribution in reaction products from that which would be expected from the mass-dependent isotope effect. On the physical basis, it is in fact a mass-dependent effect, but it surprisingly results in isotope fractionation which is incompatible with that predicted by traditional mass-dependent effects. It is supposed to be a function of dynamic parameters of reaction and energy relaxation in excited states of products. The third, nuclear volume mass-independent isotope effect is detected in the high-resolution atomic and molecular spectra and in the extraction processes, but there are no unambiguous indications of its importance as an isotope fractionation factor in chemical reactions."}

It is shown that electrons and\/or positrons undergo a cascade-type process involving multiple emissions of photons. These photons can consequently convert into electron-positron pairs. As a result charged particles quickly lose their energy developing an exponentially decaying energy distribution, which suppresses the emission of high-energy photons, thus reducing the number of electron-positron pairs being generated. Therefore, this type of interaction suppresses the development of the electromagnetic avalanche-type discharge, i.e., the exponential growth of the number of electrons, positrons, and photons does not occur in the course of interaction. The suppression will occur when three-dimensional effects can be neglected in the transverse particle orbits, i.e., for sufficiently broad laser pulses with intensities that are not too extreme. The final distributions of electrons, positrons, and photons are calculated for the case of a high-energy e-beam interacting with a counterstreaming, short intense laser pulse. The energy loss of the e-beam, which requires a self-consistent quantum description, plays an important role in this process, as well as provides a clear experimental observable for the transition from the classical to quantum regime of interaction. \u00a9 2013 American Physical Society."}

The MSR neutronics criticality behavior has significant effect in the MSR research aspect. It is important to conduct the comprehensive and systematic investigation of thermal MSR neutronics criticality behavior. In this work, the molten salt reactor type that molten salt dissolves the fuel materials is investigated. Therefore, the evaluations of different thermal MSR neutronics criticality behavior are conducted in this work. By far, various molten salt fuel types have been proposed by different research institutes based on different considerations. Consequently, the evaluation on neutronics characteristics of different molten salt fuel types and the parametric study of neutronics behavior are taken into account. Furthermore, some molten salt fuels contain the lithium element with the isotope Li-6, which has a large thermal neutron absorption cross section. The evaluation of different Li-6 concentration effects is also considered in this work. In addition to the fuel and moderators effect, other parameters such as the volume and geometry effects are also studied. Lastly, the operation temperature on the neutronics behavior is also investigated. The corresponding parameters such as multiplication factor, neutron spectrum, and temperature coefficient are evaluated. In this work, instead of the simulation of whole reactor core, the simulation of a thermal MSR fuel unit is conducted. This work provides a more complete and comprehensive evaluation approach for various parametric effect on MSR neutronics criticality behavior and offers reference for the MSR criticality design."}

After verification, it is applied to analyze the characteristics of a typical molten salt reactor, including the steady characteristics, the influence of fuel circulation on the kinetic behaviors.

However, they are deficient in the microscopic sense because of the inability to produce correlated secondary particles. Neutrons will produce the average number of gammas at each collision regardless of the specific neutron reaction. Consequently, capture gammas may be produced by elastic collisions and inelastic gammas may be produced by capture. To remedy this deficiency the Cascading Gamma-ray and Multiplicity (CGM) V3.4 code has been integrated into MCNPX V2.7.0. The CGM code is based on Hauser\u2013Feshbach and optical models. This paper details an overview of the CGM code integration into MCNPX followed by a test case highlighting the gamma spectrum and multiplicities from the CGM\/MCNPX code. The test case provides gamma spectrum and multiplicities for the ( n ,\u03b3) reaction on 56 Fe using thermal neutrons.

Different recycling options of minor actinides are discussed: transmutation in liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBRs) is possible as long as plutonium is not recycled in light water reactors (LWRs). In this case a minor actinide burner with fuel of different composition has to be introduced. The development of appropriate minor actinide fuels and their properties are described. The irradiation experiments underway or planned are summarized. A review of minor actinide partitioning from the PUREX waste stream is given. From the present constraints of LMFBR technology a reduction of the long-term \u03b1-radiological risk by a factor of 200 is deduced relative to that from the direct storage of spent LWR fuel.
