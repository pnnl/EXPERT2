Introduction. ::: ::: It is now familiar knowledge that radioactive minerals, such as uraninite and monazite, are geological clocks endowed with an unfailing mechanism for keeping time by steadily ticking out atoms of helium and lead. The method of reading these natural timekeepers is comparatively simple in principle, though the interpretation of the readings may often be difficult and even uncertain in practice. Since we know the rates at which lead is generated from thorium (Th232) and from each of the parental isotopes of uranium (UI or U238, and AcU or U235), it is possible to determine the time required for the accumulation of the lead now present in any radioactive mineral which has been analysed for Pb, U and Th. If the mineral was free from lead at the time of its formation, and if it has remained unaltered, except by its own atomic disintegrations, then the time so computed is the absolute age of the mineral. But these rigid conditions are so rarely fulfilled that it is preferable to speak only of the \u2036apparent age\u2033 of a mineral, until the effects of original lead and alterations have been suitably assessed and allowed for. Fortunately, thanks to the outstanding success of Professor A. O. Nier in separating the isotopes of lead and measuring their proportions by means of his mass spectrometer, we have recently been furnished with a wealth of accurate data which provides a new and solid basis for making such assessments with reasonable confidence. ::: ::: The purpose of this"}

These so-called \u201chot Jupiters\u201d offer the most immediate chances for direct detection and characterization. At present only one of these planets has been found to transit the face of its parent star. Its radius is that of a slightly inflated gas giant. Models of the structure and evolution of these planets are beginning to show how clues to their evolutionary history may be encoded in their mass\u2013radius\u2013age relations. Over the next few years, the prospects are good for discovery of many more transiting systems that can be used to infer mass\u2013radius relations for irradiated planets. At the same time, new optical and infrared spectral separation techniques will uncover the role played by the chemistry and physics of irradiated gas-giant atmospheres in regulating their cooling and contraction."}

Its name and chemical symbol U are derived from the planet Uranus, discovered (1781) a few years before the element. A compound of uranium (uranium oxide) was discovered in the uranium ore pitchblende by M. H. Klaproth in 1789. Klaproth believed that he had isolated the element, but this was not achieved until 1841 when a French chemist, E. M. Peligot, reduced uranium tetrachloride with potassium in a platinum crucible to obtain elemental uranium. ::: ::: ::: ::: Uranium is not as rare as once believed. Widely distributed in the earth's crust, uranium occurs to the extent of about 0.0004%, making the metal more plentiful than mercury, antimony, or silver. Before World War II, uranium was of interest only to the chemists and physicists who studied the element as they would any other substance. With the advent of the nuclear age, uranium now occupies a key position in nuclear weapons and energy. ::: ::: ::: ::: The physical and chemical properties of uranium and some of its compounds are listed. ::: ::: ::: ::: To enhance its use in reactors and nuclear weapons, uranium undergoes an industrial enrichment process that increases the 235U content from 0.7% found naturally to a content between 2 and 90%. 235U is the only natural uranium isotope that can sustain the nuclear chain reaction required for reactors and weapons processes. ::: ::: ::: ::: No deposits of concentrated uranium ore have been discovered. As a result, uranium must be extracted from ores containing less than 0.1% U. Because it is necessary to use low-grade ores, substantial and complex processing of these ores is required to obtain pure uranium. Usually it is necessary to preconcentrate the ore by grinding and flotation or similar processes. ::: ::: ::: ::: Hazardous exposures in the uranium industry begin in the mining process. Hazards are of two types, chemical and radiological; of the two, radiation is the more dangerous. Effective ventilation control measures have reduced the radiation exposures in the larger mines, but far less satisfactory radiation-exposure conditions exist in small mines without the benefit of ventilation. In addition to the alpha-particle radiation hazard from uranium in the ore, the most hazardous elements are radon gas and its particulate daughters, RaA and RaC, all alpha emitters. Some mine waters are high in radon and thus are an additional exposure source and should not be used for wet drilling. In the mines some beta and gamma exposures from RaB, RaC, and Ra also occur but are of relatively minor importance. The chemical toxicity of uranium is similar to other heavy metals. Storage in the skeleton and excretion via the urine are accompanied by renal toxicity and are discussed. ::: ::: ::: ::: Hazards in milling uranium to produce a concentrate were thought to be relatively minor because a wet process was used. However, some chronic health effects, including nonmalignant respiratory disease and renal tubular biochemical abnormalities, have been documented in these workers and are discussed. ::: ::: ::: ::: A variety of both mandatory and voluntary health-based exposure limits for uranium are derived from both its chemical and radiological toxicity. Regulating bodies include international, national, and state organizations. Some of the pertinent regulations and guidelines on exposure limits are summarized here, but the reader is cautioned to consult other sources to ensure health protection and regulatory compliance. ::: ::: ::: ::: Uranium is unusual among the elements because it presents both chemical and radiological hazards. ::: ::: ::: ::: Thorium, the second element in the actinide series, exists in the earth's crust as an unstable, radioactive element that undergoes decay by alpha emission and gives rise to a series of short-lived daughter products that ends in a stable isotope of lead. Thorium is used as a source of atomic fuel, in the production of incandescent mantles, as an alloying element with magnesium, tungsten and nickel, and in the past was used as a diagnostic agent for systemic radiological studies. Thorium is primarily a radioactive hazard in humans; however, its chemical toxicity must also be considered. ::: ::: ::: Keywords: ::: ::: Uranium; ::: Uranium compounds; ::: Thorium; ::: Thorium compounds; ::: Radon; ::: Oxides; ::: Nuclear fuel technology; ::: Tissues; ::: Smoking; ::: Miners; ::: Non-Miners; ::: Uranium mines; ::: Thorotrast; ::: Depleted uranium; ::: Uranium mills; ::: Distribution"}

Allenamides are functionally derived from allenamines,4 which along with structurally related systems such as allenol ethers5 and allenyl sulfides,6 can be classified as heteroatom-substituted allenes. Allenamines have been known for more than forty years since the first documentation of their preparations and characterizations in 1968 by Viehe.7 It is noteworthy that Viehe was at the time developing a based-catalyzed isomerization of propargyl amines as a useful protocol for synthesizing ynamines (Scheme 1), which had just come onto the scene as a useful synthetic building block.8\u201310 Allenamines were postulated as an intermediate en route to ynamines in this prototropic isomerization that follows essentially the zipper-type mechanism. ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 1 ::: ::: ::: ::: The \u03c0-donating ability of nitrogen atom renders allenamines more electron-rich than simple allenes, thereby predisposing them to electrophilic activations. An electronic bias can be exerted through delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair toward the allenic moiety as demonstrated in the resonance form of allenamines. Accordingly, highly regioselective transformations can be achieved with consecutive addition of electrophiles and nucleophiles (Scheme 2). In addition to aforementioned regiochemical control, allenamines also offer a number of other advantages over simple allenes. The trivalent nature of the nitrogen atom allows: (1) Tethering of a chirality-inducing unit for providing stereochemical induction; concomitantly with the inclusion of a coordinating unit to provide conformational rigidity; (2) a much greater flexibility in designing intramolecular reactions or tandem processes than with oxygen- or sulfur-substituted allenes; and last but not the least, (3) a novel entry to alkaloids if the nitrogen atom can be preserved throughout the entire transformative sequence. Moreover, intramolecular reaction manifolds as shown with a possible diastereoselective cyclopropanation reaction (Scheme 2) can greatly manifest these remarkable features, particularly the latter two. Therefore, while the chemistry of other heteroatom-substituted allenes is of high impact and value to organic synthesis, allenamines should prove to be more attractive for developing stereoselective methodologies as well as rapid assembly of structural complexity.1,2 ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 2 ::: ::: ::: ::: Without illustrating any specifics here on allenamine chemistry given all the comprehensive reviews,1,2 elegant precedents adopting allenamines in a range of transformations have indeed been documented to further support their synthetic potential and provoke interest from the synthetic community. Unfortunately, further developments had been severely thwarted because allenamines are also highly sensitive toward hydrolysis with a tendency to polymerize even at low temperatures (Scheme 3), thereby creating serious difficulties in their preparation and experimental handling.1,2 Consequently, the great potential of chemistry of nitrogen-substituted allenes could only be partially realized. Therefore, efforts to identify an allenamine-equivalent should be of high significance if it can strike the right balance between stability and reactivity. ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 3 ::: ::: ::: ::: Toward this end, allenamides should represent ideal candidates as a stable allenamine-equivalent. Delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair into the electron-withdrawing amido group should diminish its donating ability toward the allenic moiety, thereby leading to improved stability (Scheme 4). In short, the very simple fact that allenamides can champion an extra resonance form speaks volume of its superior stability over allenamines. It could be a great story if allenamides were a result of some clever design in search for a stable allenamine-equivalent. However, this is not true and the story is much less dramatic. Allenamides have co-existed along side of allenamines for all of the last four plus decades after Dickinson's first preparation and concise characterizations of 1,2-propadienyl-2-pyrrolidinone in 1967 (Scheme 5).11 ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 4 ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 5 ::: ::: ::: ::: In fact, Dickinson coined the term \u201callenamide\u201d to describe 1,2-propadienyl-2-pyrrolidinone based the analogy of using enamides17 for Stork\u2019s N-acylated enamines. To clarify reports by Cho12 and others,13 Dickinson concisely demonstrated that treatment of 2-pyrrolidinone with NaH and propargyl bromide had indeed led to the allenamide as the major and stable product also via the same prototropic isomerization pathway. Intriguingly, unlike Viehe\u2019s work, allenamide did not undergo further isomerization to the respective ynamide, although with further treatment of NaOMe and pyrrolidine, ynamide was postulated as an intermediate en route to the N-acyl-pyrrolidine product. Nevertheless, this documentation of ynamide actually predated Viehe\u2019s 1972 account,14 and chemistry of ynamides has indeed generated an immense amount of interest from the synthetic community in the last 15 years.15,16 ::: ::: To align with the history, our foray into this field coincides with both of Viehe and Dickinson\u2019s work. In search of a useful synthetic method to construct chiral ynamides 16 years ago,10 we found that based-catalyzed prototropic isomerization of propargyl amides reliably arrested at the allenic stage and gave none of the desired ynamides10 (Scheme 6) regardless of nature of the base used, temperature, and solvents (also see Schemes 24 and \u200band2525 vide infra). More importantly, to properly acknowledge a critical person in our entire endeavor in allenamide chemistry, I owe everything to the very first postdoctoral research fellow in my group, Dr. Lin-Li Wei [Ph.D. with Professor Teck-Peng Loh at National University of Singapore]. Dr. Wei, who was working on these isomerizations, pointed out that these allenamides that she had obtained could prove to be an excellent allenamine-equivalent, and evolve into highly versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis. ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 6 ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 24 ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 25 ::: ::: ::: ::: Given the precedent, the ease of preparation, and stability, the most critical question would be whether these allenamides could possess sufficient reactivity. A survey of the literature indicates that although it was far from a blank page, allenamides have been much less explored relative to allenamines.4,18\u201320 Precise reasons are not very clear, but there were very few citations on synthesis and applications of allenamides before 1989. While few more reports appeared from late 1980\u2019s to mid-1990\u2019s, the real outburst in chemistry of allenamides came 16 years ago, just as we also became deeply involved in the development of allenamide chemistry. Such sustained emergence strongly suggests that allenamides have set the gold standard for balancing reactivity and stability. They are becoming proven allenamine-equivalents that can be employed in a diverse array of stereoselective and intramolecular reactions that were not possible with traditional allenamines. They represent the ideal platform for pushing the limit of synthetic potential of nitrogen-substituted allenes. ::: ::: It is the purpose of this review to provide proper illustrations of the elegant chemistry involving allenamides that has come to pass, thereby eliciting a greater amount of interests from the synthetic community to create new allenamide chemistry. Lastly, this perspective that advancement of any field requires collective creativity and innovation from many people and not just a few individuals rings hollow here. On that note, although we are trying our very best to be comprehensive, it is likely that we have inadvertently missed some beautiful work for which we express our regret here in advance."}

More importantly, to properly acknowledge a critical person in our entire endeavor in allenamide chemistry, I owe everything to the very first postdoctoral research fellow in my group, Dr. Lin-Li Wei [Ph.D. with Professor Teck-Peng Loh at National University of Singapore]. Dr. Wei, who was working on these isomerizations, pointed out that these allenamides that she had obtained could prove to be an excellent allenamine-equivalent, and evolve into highly versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis. ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 6 ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 24 ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 25 ::: ::: ::: ::: Given the precedent, the ease of preparation, and stability, the most critical question would be whether these allenamides could possess sufficient reactivity. A survey of the literature indicates that although it was far from a blank page, allenamides have been much less explored relative to allenamines.4,18\u201320 Precise reasons are not very clear, but there were very few citations on synthesis and applications of allenamides before 1989. While few more reports appeared from late 1980\u2019s to mid-1990\u2019s, the real outburst in chemistry of allenamides came 16 years ago, just as we also became deeply involved in the development of allenamide chemistry. Such sustained emergence strongly suggests that allenamides have set the gold standard for balancing reactivity and stability. They are becoming proven allenamine-equivalents that can be employed in a diverse array of stereoselective and intramolecular reactions that were not possible with traditional allenamines. They represent the ideal platform for pushing the limit of synthetic potential of nitrogen-substituted allenes. ::: ::: It is the purpose of this review to provide proper illustrations of the elegant chemistry involving allenamides that has come to pass, thereby eliciting a greater amount of interests from the synthetic community to create new allenamide chemistry. Lastly, this perspective that advancement of any field requires collective creativity and innovation from many people and not just a few individuals rings hollow here. On that note, although we are trying our very best to be comprehensive, it is likely that we have inadvertently missed some beautiful work for which we express our regret here in advance."}

Among these new technologies is the development and wide implementation of flow reactors.[5-6] Conducting transformations in flow has many advantages compared to the more traditional batch reactions, in particular: more predictable reaction scale-up, decreased safety hazards, and improved reproducibility. In addition, for photochemical transformations, the high surface area to volume ratios typical of flow reactors allow for more efficient irradiation of a reaction mixture.[7] Due to this feature, we reasoned that a mesofluidic photochemical flow reactor would be amenable to our group\u2019s ongoing study of visible light induced organic transformations mediated by photoredox catalysts (Figure 1).[8] ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: Photoredox Catalysis in Flow: Enabling Increased Efficiency by Reactor Technology. ::: ::: ::: ::: Our group has studied the utilization of both the oxidative and reductive quenching cycles of photoredox catalysts to initiate synthetically useful manipulations of organic molecules such as intra- and intermolecular radical reactions,[8] formal C-H oxidations,[9] and the halogenation of alcohols.[10] During these studies, it was commonly observed that large scale reactions were often slower than those conducted on smaller scale.[11] As a consequence of the Beer-Lambert law, the penetration of visible light through a reaction medium decreases exponentially with increasing path length. We hypothesized that this may be one reason for the observed loss of reaction efficiency. To potentially circumvent this problem we sought to design a reactor having a considerably smaller path length through which the light must travel. In addition, a reactor having a greater surface area to volume ratio would result is an increased photon flux density, potentially accelerating the reaction.[12] Commercially available PFA (perfluoro alkoxy alkane) tubing having an internal diameter of 0.762 mm was identified as a viable choice due to its chemical resistance and optical transparency. Furthermore, a photoreactor of this size will allow for optimal absorbance at typical catalyst concentrations (~1.0 mM) For instance, the molar extinction coefficient of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 has been measured to be 13000 M\u22121cm\u22121,[13] as such the thickest portion of the tubing allows for the absorption of 90% of the incident radiation. Likewise, when carried out in batch reactors, 99% of the incident radiation is absorbed by the reaction medium residing within 1.5 mm of the reactor surface while the remaining internal volume receives little productive radiation.[14] ::: ::: In designing our reactor, we sought to make it as simple as possible without using specialized equipment in the hopes that a similar design could be readily implemented in other laboratories. Our optimized reactor involved wrapping 105 cm (corresponding to a 479 \u03bcL reactor volume) of PFA tubing in figure-eights around a pair of glass test tubes. We then utilized a peristaltic pump to pump the reaction mixture through the tubing with irradiation from a commercially available assembly of 7 blue LEDs.[15] Finally a silver mirrored Erlenmeyer flask was positioned above the reactor to reflect any incident light back onto the tubing. [16] ::: ::: Our initial experiments focused on the oxidative generation of iminium ions from N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines, utilizing reaction conditions similar to those we recently reported.[8c] Employing BrCCl3 as the terminal oxidant, we observed rapid formation of the iminium ion, 2, from the corresponding tetrahydroisoquinoline, 1. Optimization studies revealed that subjecting a solution of 1, BrCCl3, and Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (0.05 mol%) in DMF to irradiation in our newly designed flow photoreactor, required only a very short residence time (tR) for complete consumption of 1. In particular, pumping this mixture through the photoreactor at a rate corresponding to a tR of 0.5 min and collecting the mixture in a flask containing 5.0 equiv of a diverse set of nucleophiles allowed for the efficient and rapid generation of a variety of \u03b1-functionalized amines, in yields comparable to those observed in the batch reactions (Figure 2). As expected with the flow reactor, reaction scale up was trivial and allowed for the oxidative aza-Henry reaction of 1 with MeNO2 to be conducted on a 1.0 g scale with none of the issues observed for scaling up batch reactions. Furthermore, when conducted in batch, a reaction time of 3 h was required for complete oxidation of 1 on a 0.24 mmol scale. This corresponds to a material throughput of 0.081 mmol\/h. However, utilizing the flow apparatus (with a reactor volume of 479 \u03bcL) enables a much higher rate of substrate conversion, 5.75 mmol\/h. In addition, this rate can be increased by utilizing a photoreactor having a greater internal volume which would require only the use of a longer section of tubing. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 2 ::: ::: Oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines in flow. ::: ::: ::: ::: Having validated our hypothesis of increased reaction efficiency of photoredox mediated transformations performed in a photochemical flow setup, we examined a number of other reactions developed by our group. Firstly, a number of intramolecular radical cyclization reactions were evaluated, including: intramolecular heterocycle functionalization,[8b] hexenyl radical cyclization[8c] and a tandem radical cyclization\/Cope rearrangement sequence (Figure 3).[8g] We were delighted to find that both radical cyclizations onto heteroaromatics and terminal olefins catalyzed by Ru(bpy)3Cl2 proceeded efficiently with short residence times, 1.0 min, affording the products in yields comparable to those observed in batch reactions. Notably, the intermolecular pyrrole functionalization, when preformed on large scale in batch (>2.0 g, 6.2 mmol), failed to afford complete conversion of starting material even after prolonged reaction time (>2 days). However, the use of the flow reactor could allow for the transformation of large quantities of substrate without the need to perform multiple smaller scale reactions to achieve the desired conversion. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 3 ::: ::: Intramolecular radical reactions in flow. ::: ::: ::: ::: Likewise, the Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)PF6 catalyzed radical cyclization\/rearrangement afforded the product in good yield, but required a slightly longer residence time, tR = 3.0 min. Again, performing these reactions in flow afforded a much higher rate of material throughput when compared to the transformation conducted in batch. Notably, for the cyclization\/rearrangement cascade catalyzed by Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)PF6, the batch reaction only afforded a substrate conversion rate of 0.048 mmol\/h (cf. tR = 4.0 min corresponds to a material throughput of 0.96 mmol\/h with our photoreactor). ::: ::: Intermolecular radical reactions are also feasible in this flow setup (Figure 4). It was found that intermolecular malonation of indoles, utilizing the triarylamine reductive quencher, 4-MeO-C6H4-NPh2, proceeded smoothly with a tR = 1.0 min.[8d] Furthermore, the bromopyrroloindoline coupling with 1-methyl-indole-2- carboxaldehyde, similar to the key transformation utilized in the recent synthesis of gliocladin C from our group, proceeded efficiently with a residence time of 4.0 min.[8f] This result is particularly promising since scale up of this reaction required prolonged reaction times, up to several days for a 10 g scale reaction.[17] ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 4 ::: ::: Intermolecular radical reactions in flow. ::: ::: ::: ::: Finally, we applied this new reaction technology to our reported protocol for the intermolecular atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) utilizing the oxidative quenching pathway of the photocatalyst, Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)PF6 (Figure 5).[8e] While requiring slightly longer residence times than those observed for the transformations utilizing the reductive quenching cycle of Ru and Ir based catalysts, this transformation proceeded efficiently and cleanly to give the corresponding ATRA products in good yields. Again, a greater rate of material throughput was observed using the flow reactor. On average, the ATRA of diethyl bromomalonate in batch allowed for the conversion of 0.200 mmol of alkene per hour. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 5 ::: ::: Intermolecular ATRA reactions in flow. ::: ::: ::: ::: In summary, we have designed a readily prepared and easily implemented photochemical flow reactor which enables the marked acceleration of a variety of transformations mediated by photoredox catalysis.

In all cases the reactor employed in this work has shown an increased efficiency in terms of material throughput for all the transformations studied.

Among these new technologies is the development and wide implementation of flow reactors.[5-6] Conducting transformations in flow has many advantages compared to the more traditional batch reactions, in particular: more predictable reaction scale-up, decreased safety hazards, and improved reproducibility. In addition, for photochemical transformations, the high surface area to volume ratios typical of flow reactors allow for more efficient irradiation of a reaction mixture.[7] Due to this feature, we reasoned that a mesofluidic photochemical flow reactor would be amenable to our group\u2019s ongoing study of visible light induced organic transformations mediated by photoredox catalysts (Figure 1).[8] ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: Photoredox Catalysis in Flow: Enabling Increased Efficiency by Reactor Technology. ::: ::: ::: ::: Our group has studied the utilization of both the oxidative and reductive quenching cycles of photoredox catalysts to initiate synthetically useful manipulations of organic molecules such as intra- and intermolecular radical reactions,[8] formal C-H oxidations,[9] and the halogenation of alcohols.[10] During these studies, it was commonly observed that large scale reactions were often slower than those conducted on smaller scale.[11] As a consequence of the Beer-Lambert law, the penetration of visible light through a reaction medium decreases exponentially with increasing path length.

I take issue, however, with the description of the neutron research community as \u201csmall and fractious.\u201d The \u201cfractious\u201d aspects of our community (as Lawler amply demonstrates) are mainly within the U.S. Department of Energy and its competing national laboratories, not among neutron researchers, the large majority of whom come from universities and industries. Nor is our community \u201csmall.\u201d Well over 1000 physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and engineers participate in research in the United States every year using neutron beams, and this number has doubled in the last decade. As an example, researchers using the reactor at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has recently developed the only internationally competitive cold neutron research facility (CNRF) in the United States, have tripled since the opening of the CNRF in 1990. Moreover, these numbers do not reflect broad and critical U.S. needs for isotopes and irradiation facilities applied to medicine and technology, which also require modern neutron sources. ::: ::: Unfortunately, our community has not benefited from development of a totally new neutron source in this country for more than 25 years, and we are continuing to fall behind our international competitors, a point clearly documented by Lawler. We must find a way to meet the increasing neutron research needs of modern U.S. science and technology. Even in the face of tight budgets, we in our field must unite to make a coherent case and set priorities for critically needed investments for a new neutron source and for upgrades to existing neutron facilities. This effort must be less concerned with the needs of any particular national laboratory than with providing the best capabilities for the nation. Failure to succeed in this mission could lead to a loss of any chance for the United States to be competitive in vital neutron measurements, nuclear medicine, and related technologies, as we move into the next century. ::: ::: [1]: \/lookup\/doi\/10.1126\/science.273.5276.728"}

J. M. DeGoeij During this conference, and today in particular, we commemorate Vincent P. GUINN. It is a moment of sadness, since we are faced with a serious loss, for many of us here. We are missing Vince, as a colleague, who was always present as a participant or consultant at meetings when neutron activation analysis was under discussion. We are missing Vince, as a friend, who so often participated in social and other activities where he enjoyed meeting and entertaining people. On the other hand, in spite of our sadness, we must be grateful for the many good things we have experienced and shared with him, for so many years. Altogether, we owe him quite a lot, both scientifically and socially. Vince was a dedicated advocate of the application of radioactivity in science and technology. His very special interest was neutron activation analysis. And this was the field, in which most of us got acquainted with him in the past 40 years or so. He acted as leader, master, teacher and tutor. Also in the audience here today there are former students, scientists trained by him, or colleagues who worked closely with him. I am one of them, now giving a few personal memories. During the MTAA-10 meeting in Bethesda, in April 1999, Vince invited his friends, attending the conference, for a party in his nearby home. At that occasion I had the honour to deliver a speech and to offer him a clock as token of the friendship and appreciation of all guests. I mentioned that some guests, being former students or trainees of him, could be seen as his scientific children. Following this line, I stated that, in the meantime, he also acquired scientific grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. Vince visibly enjoyed having so many persons as his scientific offspring. Training of young people was one of his passions. Hopefully, future training of young people in neutron activation analysis may be facilitated by the Vince P. Guinn Memorial fund, recently established in honour of his honor. I met Vince for the first time in Amsterdam in May 1967. After an IAEA conference, there was a small expert meeting. This meeting was on mercury pollution and several experts were present. Vince was also a participant. This meeting was for him a stimulus to work later on the mercury pollution problem. Some years later he analysed swordfish and tuna museum specimen and showed that also in the past mercury levels were high. These results, published in the leading journal Science, however, were not everywhere appreciated. In the early seventies I wanted to stay for some time with Vince. There were many letters and phone calls back and forth, but Vince was not able to accommodate me. In the end, I gave up the idea to stay abroad, and bought a house. Next day there was a letter from Vince that I could come, under the condition that I came right away. I had to participate in a project, which already had started, however, without a proper person to do the job. The house bought was still under construction, and Miriam and I had planned to get married some months after completion of the house. What to do? Well, no time to loose. We had to speed up the marriage. After a short honeymoon, I left immediately for UC Irvine. The completion of the house could not be speeded up, and Miriam came to Irvine only a few months after me. To make a long story short, after all I am grateful to Vince that all went the way it did. In my work at Irvine Vince left me freedom and responsibility. Not so much since he was also travelling quite a lot, but this was simply his attitude. Vince instructed people well and after that, he trusted them to do the job properly. However, they should always be able to answer all his questions adequately. He treated young students actually the same as elder people who said that they had had considerable experience or did not want to do any manual work. Another feature I do remember quite well, is that he was generally rather relaxed, even when a pile of back work was on his desk. And when the office hours had ended, Vince remained in his office, quietly smoking. This was the time for a chat with students, guests or others. Various topics were discussed, but mostly the focus was on radionuclides and neutron activation analysis. His favourite subject for the after-office-hours discussion was the forensic application of neutron activation analysis. In this matter Vince tried to be especially careful and detailed, even more than he usually was in procedures and wording. He treated me sometimes as if I was a jury which had to be convinced. In return, he got from me questions and comments, he never would expect from a jury. After so many years, I vividly recall these fascinating discussions on forensic applications."}

The reported power ranges from a few milliwatts to over 100 watts with most studies reporting values at the low end of this range. The large range in values is caused by accidental creation of the necessary physical structures that are required to initiate the heat producing reactions, called the nuclear active environment (NAE). This environment requires a very large concentration of deuterons and involves structures having nano-sized dimensions. Although focus has been applied mostly to palladium, other elements are apparently involved. Identification and creation of the NAE is essential to being able to achieve the effect with reliability and at high levels. Therefore, this effect is controlled by the nature of a special material and the existence of heretofore unrecognized processes that can allow the chemical environment to interact with nuclear processes. When the power is maintained for sufficient time, the amount of energy is found to be much greater than can be produced by any known chemical reaction. This was the first indication of a nuclear reaction being the source of energy. Many studies have shown the main heat producing reaction results in helium-4 without significant radiation being detected outside of the apparatus. Tritium is also produced occasionally in small amounts. Even fewer numbers of neutrons are detected and these apparently result from secondary reactions caused by energetic particles resulting from the primary fusion reaction interacting with ambient deuterium. Although this primary radiation is not easily detected, use of proper detectors located very near the source has shown the presence of X-rays and energetic particles. Therefore, nuclear reactions clearly are being initiated in special materials under normal, ambient conditions. In addition to evidence for a fusion reaction involving deuterons, nuclear products resulting from transmutation are also detected. These isotopes result from addition of deuterons and perhaps protons to the nucleus of targets of opportunity in the NAE. Most of the products are stable isotopes but occasionally radioactive isotopes are produced other than tritium. These isotopes result from clusters of deuterons up to 10 members entering the nucleus at the same time. Evidence for addition of a single deuteron or proton has also been reported. The mechanism producing this rare type of reaction is still a challenge for theory."}

Protein kinases regulate cellular processes by a highly controlled series of phosphorylation reactions, frequently with some kinases acting as substrates for other kinases.[4] Deregulated kinase activity is a frequent cause of disease, particularly cancer,[5, 6] where kinases regulate many aspects concerning controlling metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, movement, and death (apoptosis).[7] It has been estimated that approximately 500 protein kinases are encoded within the human genome;[8] this represents approximately 1.7 % of all human genes.[8] Most of the 30 known tumor suppressor genes and more than 100 dominant oncogenes are protein kinases.[9] ::: ::: For the development of useful drugs it is essential to screen a variety of chemical libraries for potent kinase inhibitors and to assess their inhibitory potency toward a particular protein kinase. Therefore, biochemical studies on protein kinases are important not only for basic biology to clarify molecular mechanisms of signal transduction, but also for clinical pharmacology to develop novel anticancer agents.[5] Targeted therapy will most presumably result in more effective treatment with fewer negative side effects than those currently associated with standard chemotherapy. ::: ::: Basically two different approaches can be used to study protein kinases.[10, 11] One is to characterize an individual protein kinase in detail by measuring its kinase activity. The second approach is to comprehensively analyze the extent of phosphorylation of substrate proteins or expression profiles of protein kinases themselves. In the past, radiometric assays utilizing radioactive ATP have been used. Owing the environmental impact of waste materials, radiometric methods have largely been replaced by approaches employing fluorescent measurements. A further factor driving the development of a large number of fluorescent assays has been the rapid growth in the number of available phosphoprotein- and phosphopeptide-specific antibodies. ::: ::: While biochemical assays for protein phosphorylation are easily carried out, they cannot duplicate the environment of the cell.[11, 12] Cellular phosphorylation cascades are multi-directional pathways rather than single biochemical reactions. Although a particular member of a signaling pathway may be effectively inhibited by a candidate drug, the pathway itself may remain unaffected owing to alternative signaling routes that bypass the targeted kinase. Therefore, the behavior of a drug in a biochemical assay may not correlate with the behavior in either whole cells or in an animal.[11\u201313] To more precisely assess the effects of a drug compound on a kinase-mediated pathway, cell-based assay formats must be used to validate the inhibitory effects of a drug candidate on both the target and the targeted pathway. Whole-cell formats also allow a simultaneous assessment of drug penetration and toxicity.[11\u201313] For this reason there is the hope that the application of cell-based assays will result in fewer failures further on in clinical development processes. ::: ::: While most of the cell-based assays access advanced biochemical methods employing classical fluorescent or radio-labeled markers,[11, 12] (bio)luminescent detection,[11, 14] and impedance-based measurements,[15] a new cell-based assay applying \u201cintelligent\u201d nanoparticles has recently been introduced (Figure 1).[16] This assay detects protein kinase activities without treatment with phosphopeptide-specific antibodies, without time-consuming washing steps, and without the limitation to cells genetically modified to express fluorescent protein reporters. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: The the imaging of protein kinase activity with polymeric nanoparticles.

Upon peptide phosphorylation, the PKA-specific substrate kemptide in the PIC nanoparticles becomes phosphorylated, and the negatively charged phosphate groups are incorporated into the serine residue of kemptide (Figure 1). The additional negatively charged phosphate groups cause a charge-unbalanced state, resulting in dissolution of the PIC nanoparticle. As a consequence, the distance of between the Cy5.5 fluorochromes increases, leading to diminished quenching efficiency. Thus, the intensity of the NIR fluorescence intensity increases significantly and reaches levels approximately 8 times greater than those of cells without the PIC nanoparticles (Figure 2).

Protein kinases regulate cellular processes by a highly controlled series of phosphorylation reactions, frequently with some kinases acting as substrates for other kinases.[4] Deregulated kinase activity is a frequent cause of disease, particularly cancer,[5, 6] where kinases regulate many aspects concerning controlling metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, movement, and death (apoptosis).[7] It has been estimated that approximately 500 protein kinases are encoded within the human genome;[8] this represents approximately 1.7 % of all human genes.[8] Most of the 30 known tumor suppressor genes and more than 100 dominant oncogenes are protein kinases.[9] ::: ::: For the development of useful drugs it is essential to screen a variety of chemical libraries for potent kinase inhibitors and to assess their inhibitory potency toward a particular protein kinase. Therefore, biochemical studies on protein kinases are important not only for basic biology to clarify molecular mechanisms of signal transduction, but also for clinical pharmacology to develop novel anticancer agents.[5] Targeted therapy will most presumably result in more effective treatment with fewer negative side effects than those currently associated with standard chemotherapy. ::: ::: Basically two different approaches can be used to study protein kinases.[10, 11] One is to characterize an individual protein kinase in detail by measuring its kinase activity. The second approach is to comprehensively analyze the extent of phosphorylation of substrate proteins or expression profiles of protein kinases themselves. In the past, radiometric assays utilizing radioactive ATP have been used. Owing the environmental impact of waste materials, radiometric methods have largely been replaced by approaches employing fluorescent measurements.

This reaction is catalyzed by HMBPP reductase (IspH), a monomeric enzyme that consists of three domains binding to a redox-active [Fe4S4] cluster in its central cavity (Figure 1a).[4] The cluster is linked to the protein by the side-chains of three cysteine residues, and one of the iron atoms possesses an unoccupied coordination site that has not been found to bind to any amino acid residue. Mechanistic studies with wild type Escherichia coli IspH as well as IspH mutants have revealed two different conformations of 1 inside the active site that are adopted in the catalytic cycle (Figure 1b and c): one in which O1 binds to the 4th iron atom, and a second in which it undergoes numerous hydrogen bond interactions with its diphosphate group and protein residues.[5] ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: Crystal structure of IspH in complex with 1. a) Top and side view of the overall structure of E. coli IspH.

One-electron reduction of the cluster results in [Fe4S4]+ with spin S=1\/2, and correlates with a rotation of the ligand's hydroxymethyl group away from the cluster to form a cyclic conformation (state II) which has essential impact on the stereochemical course of the IspH reaction.[7] The transfer of two electrons from the cofactor to the substrate produces a HiPIP-type [Fe4S4]3+ cluster and leads to C-O bond cleavage and water release. The allyl anion (state III) then abstracts a proton from the diphosphate group, either at the ligand's C2 or C4 atom, to form IPP and DMAPP, respectively. ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 2 ::: ::: Proposed mechanism of IspH catalysis. ::: ::: ::: ::: Besides the intensive investigation of the IspH reaction mechanism, a remarkable effort was put into the design and characterization of inhibitors.[8] Recently, synthesis and spectroscopic studies of three substrate analogs with the hydroxyl group in HMBPP replaced by fluoro (4)[9], amino (5)[10], or thiol (6) groups have been reported. Compound 4 is slowly converted by IspH, whereas 5 and 6 inhibit the enzyme. In order to analyze the structure-function relationship of these derivatives we synthesized 4[11], 5[12], and 6 (see SI), performed co-crystallization with E. coli IspH and determined the crystal structure of the complexes. ::: ::: The X-ray structure of IspH in complex with the fluoro analog 4 was determined to 1.8 A resolution [Rfree = 23.2%, Figure 2a, Protein Data Bank (PDB)[13] ID 4H4C] and reveals that 4 binds to the active site of IspH in a similar way as the substrate 1.[14] However, the C-F bond is rotated by 106\u00b0 compared to the C-O bond in the IspH:1 complex (Figure 2b), the fluorine atom is thus located inside a hydrophobic pocket stabilized by van der Waals interactions with His74C\u03b4 (3.6 A), Ala73C (3.9 A), and Ala73C\u03b2 (3.9 A). This unique conformation allows water molecules to occupy positions W1 and W2.[14] Although it displays an unusual orientation, 4 is converted to 2 or 3 by IspH, but with a decreased rate (kcat = 28 min\u22121) compared to 1 (kcat = 604 min\u22121). The differences in these reaction rates are likely due, at least in part, to the increased bond energies of C-F versus C-O.[15] Furthermore, the lack of a direct interaction with the apical iron atom leads to the high Km value of 4 (Km = 104 \u03bcM) compared to 1 (Km = 20 \u03bcM). ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 2 ::: ::: Complex structure of IspH bound to the fluorinated derivative 4. a) Active site of IspH showing the bound ligand and two water molecules.

However, it is not immediately obvious that 5 binds to the 4th iron atom via its amino group, or whether it forms an alternative complex that allows a water molecule to coordinate to the 4th iron atom as previously observed with an acetylene inhibitor.[8c] ::: ::: The structure of 5 in complex with IspH was determined to 1.35 A resolution (Rfree = 21.0% Figure 3a, PDB[13] ID 4H4D) and clearly shows two ligand conformations within the same crystal[16]: (i) a ligand-cluster complex in which the amino group coordinates to the apical iron atom and (ii) a conformation in which the amino group is rotated by approximately 74\u00b0 in the opposite direction to that observed with 4. The amino-iron complex is similar to that seen with the alkoxide-iron complex formed by 1 (Figure 3b), indicating that the affinity of the free amino group with the [Fe4S2]2+ cluster is comparable to that of the hydroxyl group. The second conformation observed in the crystal structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the amino (or ammonium) group to one of the diphosphate oxygen atoms (2.8 A), Glu126Oe (2.9 A) and Thr167O\u03b3 (3.1 A), and a water molecule in the W1 position (3.1 A). ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 3 ::: ::: X-ray structure of IspH in complex with the amino derivative 5. a) Active site with the ligand in two orientations.

One possible explanation for this is the formation of a stable ammonium-carboxylate ion pair that prevents the release of ammonia (Scheme 4). ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 4 ::: ::: Mechanism of IspH catalysis with 1 and inhibition by 5. a) Dehydroxylation of 1, facilitated by an acidic proton donor (Glu126OH or the diphosphate) represented by X-OH. b) Corresponding hypothetical reaction with 5. c) Formation of a stable ammonium-carboxylate ... ::: ::: ::: ::: Next, we determined the crystal structure of IspH bound to 6 to 1.7 A resolution (Rfree = 21.3%, Figure 4a, PDB[13] ID 4H4E), which displays complex formation between the unique iron atom of the cluster and the thiol group of 6. No solvent molecule is located in the active site, since the increased size of the bridging group leads to movement of the hydrocarbon chain of 6 towards the diphosphate moiety. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond network is modified, preventing the stabilization of the water molecules in the position as found in the IspH:1 complex (Figure 4b). The coordination by the ligand's thiol group generates a [Fe4S4] cluster that is coordinated by four sulfur ligands, similar to that found in most proteins catalyzing electron transfer reactions.[18] ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 4 ::: ::: IspH bound to the thiol derivative 6. a) Active site with thiol-iron complex. The electron density map is displayed according to Figure 2a. b) Structural superposition of IspH:6 with the alkoxide complex in the IspH:1 structure and the cyclic ligand orientation ... ::: ::: ::: ::: In conclusion, the results presented here provide new insights into the mechanism of the IspH reaction with the artificial substrate 4, which involves a previously unknown intermediate that is not bound to the [Fe4S4] cluster. With the amino (5) and thiol (6) species, we find in both cases that the ligands bind to the 4th iron atom. However, it still remains to be determined whether IspH inhibition is due to bonding of these ligands to the oxidized protein, the reduced protein, or both. With 5, we see evidence for a second conformation in which the side-chain is not interacting with the cluster and propose formation of a non-reactive ion-pair complex with Glu126Oe and the diphosphate group (possibly in both oxidized and reduced IspH). As expected, the IspH:6 complex reveals that the ligand's sulfur atom binds to the 4th iron atom, and there is no alternative conformation, most likely due to the fact that the SH group is a poor base\/hydrogen bond acceptor. The structures of these substrate analogs thus provide new mechanistic insights, as well as suggest novel strategies for the development of antibiotic and antimalarial drugs."}

One-electron reduction of the cluster results in [Fe4S4]+ with spin S=1\/2, and correlates with a rotation of the ligand's hydroxymethyl group away from the cluster to form a cyclic conformation (state II) which has essential impact on the stereochemical course of the IspH reaction.[7] The transfer of two electrons from the cofactor to the substrate produces a HiPIP-type [Fe4S4]3+ cluster and leads to C-O bond cleavage and water release. The allyl anion (state III) then abstracts a proton from the diphosphate group, either at the ligand's C2 or C4 atom, to form IPP and DMAPP, respectively. ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 2 ::: ::: Proposed mechanism of IspH catalysis. ::: ::: ::: ::: Besides the intensive investigation of the IspH reaction mechanism, a remarkable effort was put into the design and characterization of inhibitors.[8] Recently, synthesis and spectroscopic studies of three substrate analogs with the hydroxyl group in HMBPP replaced by fluoro (4)[9], amino (5)[10], or thiol (6) groups have been reported. Compound 4 is slowly converted by IspH, whereas 5 and 6 inhibit the enzyme. In order to analyze the structure-function relationship of these derivatives we synthesized 4[11], 5[12], and 6 (see SI), performed co-crystallization with E. coli IspH and determined the crystal structure of the complexes. ::: ::: The X-ray structure of IspH in complex with the fluoro analog 4 was determined to 1.8 A resolution [Rfree = 23.2%, Figure 2a, Protein Data Bank (PDB)[13] ID 4H4C] and reveals that 4 binds to the active site of IspH in a similar way as the substrate 1.[14] However, the C-F bond is rotated by 106\u00b0 compared to the C-O bond in the IspH:1 complex (Figure 2b), the fluorine atom is thus located inside a hydrophobic pocket stabilized by van der Waals interactions with His74C\u03b4 (3.6 A), Ala73C (3.9 A), and Ala73C\u03b2 (3.9 A). This unique conformation allows water molecules to occupy positions W1 and W2.[14] Although it displays an unusual orientation, 4 is converted to 2 or 3 by IspH, but with a decreased rate (kcat = 28 min\u22121) compared to 1 (kcat = 604 min\u22121). The differences in these reaction rates are likely due, at least in part, to the increased bond energies of C-F versus C-O.[15] Furthermore, the lack of a direct interaction with the apical iron atom leads to the high Km value of 4 (Km = 104 \u03bcM) compared to 1 (Km = 20 \u03bcM). ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 2 ::: ::: Complex structure of IspH bound to the fluorinated derivative 4. a) Active site of IspH showing the bound ligand and two water molecules. A 2FO-FC omit electron density map (blue mesh, contoured at 1.0 \u03c3) is shown for the [Fe4S4] cluster, the ... ::: ::: ::: ::: Recent inhibition studies have shown that the amino and thiol substrate analogs 5 and 6 exhibit potent inhibition of IspH with IC50 values of 0.15 \u03bcM and 0.21 \u03bcM, respectively.[10] Additionally, Mosbauer spectroscopy has suggested that both ligands interact with the [Fe4S4] cluster. However, it is not immediately obvious that 5 binds to the 4th iron atom via its amino group, or whether it forms an alternative complex that allows a water molecule to coordinate to the 4th iron atom as previously observed with an acetylene inhibitor.[8c] ::: ::: The structure of 5 in complex with IspH was determined to 1.35 A resolution (Rfree = 21.0% Figure 3a, PDB[13] ID 4H4D) and clearly shows two ligand conformations within the same crystal[16]: (i) a ligand-cluster complex in which the amino group coordinates to the apical iron atom and (ii) a conformation in which the amino group is rotated by approximately 74\u00b0 in the opposite direction to that observed with 4. The amino-iron complex is similar to that seen with the alkoxide-iron complex formed by 1 (Figure 3b), indicating that the affinity of the free amino group with the [Fe4S2]2+ cluster is comparable to that of the hydroxyl group. The second conformation observed in the crystal structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the amino (or ammonium) group to one of the diphosphate oxygen atoms (2.8 A), Glu126Oe (2.9 A) and Thr167O\u03b3 (3.1 A), and a water molecule in the W1 position (3.1 A). ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 3 ::: ::: X-ray structure of IspH in complex with the amino derivative 5. a) Active site with the ligand in two orientations. The electron density map is displayed according to Figure 2a. b) Superposition of the IspH:5 complex structures with the alkoxide complex ... ::: ::: ::: ::: The amino-iron complex is in good agreement with the Mosbauer spectroscopic data indicating a tetrahedral (3S\/N) coordination sphere at the apical iron atom.[10] Thus, it seems likely that the alternative conformation may have arisen due to cluster reduction in the X-ray beam \u2013 a result that would be of particular interest in the context of inhibition of the IspH reaction which is, of course, carried out under reducing conditions.[17] However, unlike with 1, no turnover was observed with 5. One possible explanation for this is the formation of a stable ammonium-carboxylate ion pair that prevents the release of ammonia (Scheme 4). ::: ::: ::: ::: Scheme 4 ::: ::: Mechanism of IspH catalysis with 1 and inhibition by 5. a) Dehydroxylation of 1, facilitated by an acidic proton donor (Glu126OH or the diphosphate) represented by X-OH. b) Corresponding hypothetical reaction with 5. c) Formation of a stable ammonium-carboxylate ... ::: ::: ::: ::: Next, we determined the crystal structure of IspH bound to 6 to 1.7 A resolution (Rfree = 21.3%, Figure 4a, PDB[13] ID 4H4E), which displays complex formation between the unique iron atom of the cluster and the thiol group of 6. No solvent molecule is located in the active site, since the increased size of the bridging group leads to movement of the hydrocarbon chain of 6 towards the diphosphate moiety. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond network is modified, preventing the stabilization of the water molecules in the position as found in the IspH:1 complex (Figure 4b). The coordination by the ligand's thiol group generates a [Fe4S4] cluster that is coordinated by four sulfur ligands, similar to that found in most proteins catalyzing electron transfer reactions.[18] ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 4 ::: ::: IspH bound to the thiol derivative 6. a) Active site with thiol-iron complex. The electron density map is displayed according to Figure 2a. b) Structural superposition of IspH:6 with the alkoxide complex in the IspH:1 structure and the cyclic ligand orientation ... ::: ::: ::: ::: In conclusion, the results presented here provide new insights into the mechanism of the IspH reaction with the artificial substrate 4, which involves a previously unknown intermediate that is not bound to the [Fe4S4] cluster. With the amino (5) and thiol (6) species, we find in both cases that the ligands bind to the 4th iron atom. However, it still remains to be determined whether IspH inhibition is due to bonding of these ligands to the oxidized protein, the reduced protein, or both. With 5, we see evidence for a second conformation in which the side-chain is not interacting with the cluster and propose formation of a non-reactive ion-pair complex with Glu126Oe and the diphosphate group (possibly in both oxidized and reduced IspH). As expected, the IspH:6 complex reveals that the ligand's sulfur atom binds to the 4th iron atom, and there is no alternative conformation, most likely due to the fact that the SH group is a poor base\/hydrogen bond acceptor. The structures of these substrate analogs thus provide new mechanistic insights, as well as suggest novel strategies for the development of antibiotic and antimalarial drugs."}

Because science education should promote a responsibility to a given profession [1] [2], the purpose of this Letter to the Editor is to describe how human rights and chemical education are intricately wound together. The 1970s was a high point of the human rights movement, even among scientists, there used to be a great deal of activism, but this activism declined in recent years. To reverse the trend, I describe the need of involving students without necessarily introducing material to the curriculum. ::: ::: Why do human rights matter in the context of chemical education? Education by itself cannot guarantee that graduating science students will make ethical decisions [3] [4]. The Second World War showed that education alone was not enough to prevent human rights violations [5]. One can shudder at the damage done when science and engineering were applied to exterminate people, whether it was the pseudo-science of physicians and their treatment of concentration camp prisoners [6], or the engineers who designed the gas chambers. My own personal motivation for becoming involved in scientific freedom and human rights has to do with the atrocities committed during this period of history, and survivors whose lives have touched mine [7 \u2013 11]. ::: ::: How is human rights defined? Here, we favor a specific definition, including protection of academic freedom, helping the release of prisoners of conscience, freeing dissident scientists and preventing their executions. General concepts that are less tangibly connected to human rights include access to clean water, health care delivery, education opportunities, etc. The distinction between specific and general approaches to human rights is elaborated below; resemblance to the organic chemistry concept of specific and general acid catalysis is intentional, but it does not mean individual vs. collective as in self-determination. ::: ::: The specific human rights\u2019 focus is distinct, it advocates directly individuals who have suffered human rights abuses. This specific action is meant to respond to late- breaking or immediate human rights violations. It is committed to protecting the rights of individuals. The general approach is different, it defines the human rights landscape broadly by focusing on the rights of members of a society as a whole, and can be a worthy but often long-range goal. Thus, specific vs. general approaches to human rights is one of the contents where opinions as to which to adopt differ among scientific organizations. ::: ::: A number of human rights committees have been abolished in major scientific organizations [12]. For example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has not focused on individual human rights cases for roughly five years. The future of the New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) human rights committee is in question, and will probably dissolve. One desire is not to agitate over human rights improvements in countries with spotty records, and instead to promote general issues of international collaboration and cooperation [12] [13]. Recently, the American Chemical Society Subcommittee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights \u2013 active for 26 years \u2013 was dissolved. The issue of human rights is now spread over the International Activities Committee in the Society without input from a specialized and well-informed subcommittee. ::: ::: Worthy but long-range human rights goals include the articulation of Article 15 of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), adopted in 1966, which provides that everyone has a right to the benefits of science, including the protection of scientists and of international scientific cooperation. Patience is required in human rights work, which can be emphasized with chemistry students along with gaining diplomatic experience. The signs of improvement can be very slow. One can consider the decades-long perspective regarding the development of UN human rights machinery. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights came into existence; in 1976, the fundamental international law documents (the two UN Covenants) became enforceable; in 2002, the International Criminal Court began under difficult circumstances to apply some aspects of international law [14]. Unfortunately, UN programs are not enforced by the UN Human Rights Committee. Instead, the committee deals only with States Parties on human rights implementation in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). ::: ::: While thousands of undergraduate chemistry programs are offered in the US, only a handful of programs specifically involve human rights as a part of the training of chemistry majors. Among these, Jeffrey Toney\u2019s at Kean University and ours at Brooklyn College are exceptions. Toney uses a clever strategy that can stimulate students\u2019 interest in human rights. For example, when discussing the chemistry of arsenic and its adverse health effects, an inquiry is made on whom in class is from Bangladesh to resonate aspects of students\u2019 life experience with human rights. In my sophomore organic and advanced organic chemistry classes at Brooklyn College, a solicitation for participation with the Committee of Concerned Scientists (CCS) is written on the classroom chalkboard, which draws the attention of some. The CCS is a nonprofit organization of scientists, scholars, and physicians who protect and advance human rights and scientific freedom, whose origins come from restrictions of mobility of scientists in the Soviet Union. Among the four Brooklyn College chemistry students that have participated, two can be mentioned: Alvaro Castillo assisted with electronic petitions as an integrative approach to compliment letter writing. Maria Mercedes used on-line resources and personal inquiries into cases of persecuted faculty in Colombia and Venezuela. Activities are focused on letter writing, in connection with the CCS, and on informing scientific societies of abuses to pool efforts, such as countering a proposed boycott of Israeli scientists from attending international scientific conferences, which my colleague Zafra Lerman and I raised concern about [15]. There are other potential ways to introduce human rights to students. A separate course may not be necessary,but every instructor could cite a single case study in the course of their lecture, so that students get recurring examples throughout their career. This strategy helps address the question of where to find time for it, but may not give students a comprehensive or compelling picture of the situation. ::: ::: A rhetorical question is: What are the barriers to integrating human rights with chemical education? The obvious objections will be a lack of time to commit to it, faculty that are uninterested in the subject and are neither knowledgeable nor willing to educate themselves. Also, the current polarized political climate in the US is often hostile to certain ideas. Fortunately, there are recurrent themes, even symmetry or patterns in how organizations approach human rights problems. The Welfare of Scientists Working Group at AAAS advocates the importance of coalition building and provides a list of science organizations with active human rights committees. The ACS has Network Alerts and a Network for Education and Academic Rights with calls for individual letters on behalf of scientists. The Committee of Concerned Scientists [16] and Scholars at Risk [17] maintain websites with information on recent cases. The chemical education\/human rights interface is unique, its future could provide continuity and opportunities for those students graduating and seeking roles as life-long activists defending human rights. An ACS human rights subcommittee could assist in such opportunities for chemistry majors. ::: ::: The arguments made above can apply to all natural sciences, including chemistry. The incorporation of specific human rights problem solving can help diminish unchecked violations as a growing condition, which can advance to a larger-scale end problem. That is, early intervention can serve to enhance security now, whereas instability and even war can be \u2018viewed\u2019 as a later stage of human rights problems [18].

It seems advantageous for the cell to have separate transport mechanisms for water and protons so it can control cell volume and metabolism independently. From this biological point of view, it is not surprising that protons are unable to flow through aquaporins. The chemical point of view is different, however. Protons hardly move through protein channels filled with water, but they move very easily through water, and ice, by some variation of the so-called Grotthuss mechanism involving proton\/charge exchange, rather than electrodiffusion of a cationic water moiety. It is necessary then to explain why protons cannot move easily through a water channel as they do through an aqueous solution or ice.

Most theoretical studies\u2014building on earlier conceptual models of proton transport (e.g., Nagle and Morowitz, 1978)\u2014have more or less assumed that proton flow in channels is controlled by a one-dimensional version of the Grotthuss mechanism, with a column of waters forming a proton wire threading through the channel protein (e.g., Fu et al., 2000; de Groot and Grubmuller, 2001; Kong and Ma, 2001; Law and Sansom, 2002; Tajkhorshid et al., 2002; DeCoursey, 2003).

Burykin and Warshel (2003) found (see their Fig. 4) that the barrier for proton transport is enormous (\u223c15 kcal\/mol), whereas the barrier for water transport is small (<2 kcal\/mol). The main source of the barrier was the (mostly electrostatic) desolvation penalty of moving the proton charge from bulk solution to water molecules in the channel interior. The dielectric properties of the protein dominate this electrostatic barrier, and the protein permanent dipoles and ionized groups contribute to its shape. The effects of perfect water orientation are relatively small in membrane proteins embedded in lipid bilayers because the electrostatic barriers are much larger in such systems.

The most widely used isotope studied with AMS is 14C. Besides radiocarbon dating, this isotope is used in climate studies, biomedicine applications, and many other fields. Worldwide, more than 100 000 14C samples are measured per year. Other isotopes studied include 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, 59Ni, 129I, U, and Pu.

In crystals, short distances between pairs of atoms in neighbouring molecules \u2013 \u2018contact\u2019 distances, van der Waals distances \u2013 do not necessarily correspond to specific bonding interactions between the atoms concerned. They may indeed sometimes be associated with a lowering of the potential energy associated with a specific attractive force between the atoms concerned \u2013 bonding \u2013 but they may also be associated with an increase in potential energy and a repulsive force.

Far from producing a lowering of the crystal energy, this stacking interaction in itself leads to an increase by several thousand kJ mol\u22121 arising from Coulombic repulsion between the doubly negatively charged anions. This large destabilization is, of course, more than compensated in the overall energy balance by the large stabilization arising from Coulombic interactions of the croconate anions with the surrounding cations. ::: ::: Individual atom\u2013atom pair interactions in crystals may attract attention for one reason or another, but they are seldom structure determining. Rather they emerge from the overall packing of the molecules in the crystal as a whole, involving the interactions of each molecule with all the other molecules in its vicinity. ::: ::: The interaction energy between any particular pair of molecules in an actual or hypothetical crystal structure can be estimated by quantum mechanical calculations at various levels of complexity or by the Pixel method, based on the computed charge density distributions of the individual molecules. Interaction energies obtained by these methods are usually in good overall agreement, allowing for minor systematic discrepancies. Interaction energies for neighbouring molecular pairs in a crystal need not all be negative. Molecules in close proximity in a crystal may attract one another or they may repel one another; only the total energy sum for the crystal as a whole must be negative. There is no reason to assume that the interaction between any particular pair of atoms in neighbouring molecules is bonding simply because the distance between these atoms lies in some particular range. Generally, for any given type of intermolecular atom\u2013atom interaction in a crystal, C\u2013H\u22efC, C\u2013H\u22efO, C\u2013H\u22efF, C\u2013H\u22efCl or C\u2013Cl\u22efCl, etc., there is a spread of internuclear distances around the van der Waals radius sum. Atom\u2013atom force fields, which came into use some fifty years ago, are based on atom\u2013atom pair interaction energies as function of internuclear distance. Atom\u2013atom potentials from different force fields differ in many ways \u2013 functional form and parametrization \u2013 but all agree in their general form. This is a shallow \u2212ar\u2212 6 type potential coupled to a very steep +br 12 type repulsive term; a gentle downward slope ending in a steep wall.

Indeed, hydrogen bonding is the only type of interaction that is important both at the intra- and intermolecular levels. As an example of the former we have the internal hydrogen bond in the hydrogen maleate anion, associated with the unusually large difference of four pK units between the two acid strengths of maleic acid (pK a = 1.8 and 6.1; compare fumaric acid with pK a = 3.9 and 4.4). On the intermolecular side, we have the prime example of the ice crystal, with its remarkably high melting point (compared with dihydrogen sulfide), held together entirely by O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, as well as countless other examples. ::: ::: Whereas the energies associated with the weakest covalent bonds in molecules are of the order of 150 kJ mol\u22121, energies associated with intermolecular pair interactions seem to have no lower limit. Should one then attempt to set a limit? It would not be easy. In any case, there is a fundamental difference between the two types of bonding, intra- and intermolecular. The energy of a particular intramolecular bond can sometimes be measured directly, at least in principle. By experiment or by calculation, the molecule in question can be dissociated into two discrete fragments by severing the bond, and the energy change in this process can be measured or calculated by some suitable procedure. The result can be identified with the bond breaking energy. Linus Pauling\u2019s Nature of the Chemical Bond describes many examples. For intermolecular bonding, the two molecules in question can in principle be drawn apart along the direction of the putative intermolecular bond, but the energy change associated with this process can no longer be identified exclusively with the separation of the two atoms concerned. Other intermolecular pair distances must change in the separation process, so the energy change cannot be identified with any particular pair. ::: ::: As an extension of Richard Bader\u2019s Atoms in Molecules approach, evidence for specific bonding interactions between pairs of atoms in neighboring molecules, such as those in molecular crystals, has been adduced. The evidence in question comes from the extension of bond path analysis from the intramolecular to the intermolecular level. A bond path (in the Bader sense) is a line along which the electron density \u03c1(r) connecting two atomic nuclei is a maximum with respect to any neighboring line; the electron density and its curvature at the saddle point along the bond path provide a measure of the strength of the electronic \u2018glue\u2019 holding the atoms together along the bond path. Covalent bonds in molecules yield characteristic bond paths. For the intermolecular case, the matter is more controversial. Since the electron density between molecules in crystals is orders of magnitude less than the electron density between bonded atoms in molecules, intermolecular bond paths are far weaker and more difficult to distinguish from the background. Nevertheless, countless publications claiming the observation of such intermolecular bond paths in electron density distributions derived from experimental X-ray diffraction measurements of molecular crystals have appeared in the scientific literature, and the question arises as to whether such results provide compelling evidence of intermolecular atom\u2013atom pair bonding or whether they could just as well arise from simple overlapping of atomic electron densities. For example, it has been shown by Mark Spackman and Carlo Gatti that bond paths for hydrogen bonds derived from experimental electron densities in crystals are close to those obtained by simple addition of non-interacting, overlapping, spherical atom electron densities. If bond paths for hydrogen bonds are in question, what confidence can we have in claims for the observation of bond paths for other types of intermolecular contact? ::: ::: The purpose of this little essay is to pose the question: should the observation of short distances between pairs of atoms on the peripheries of different molecules in crystals be regarded as evidence of specific intermolecular bonding between the atoms concerned? And if the answer is not yes but no or perhaps or sometimes: how are we to distinguish the bonding atom\u2013atom interaction from the energetically neutral or anti-bonding type? Do we need another IUPAC commission to decide?"}

Two questions immediately arise: ::: ::: ::: Given a source of non-classical light, how does one work out the effect of coupling it to a quantum system? ::: ::: ::: In a theoretical context, how does one specify a non-classical light beam? With thermal or squeezed light beams this is normally done by assuming that they are Gaussian, which is theoretically true, though in principle practical squeezed beams may deviate from being exactly Gaussian. For Gaussian beams the means and second order correlation functions specify all higher correlation functions, so that one need only specify these to specify the beam exactly. There is no such simple method for non-Gaussian beams, such as antibunched beams."}
